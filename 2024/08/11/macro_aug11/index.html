<h3 id="US-Market"><a href="#US-Market" class="headerlink" title="US Market : "></a>US Market : <br><br></h3><p><strong>The US stock market experienced a modest decline this week after rebounding from its most significant sell-off in nearly two years, which was partly driven by a partial unwinding of the carry trade and fears for a potential US recession.</strong> On Monday morning, the S&amp;P 500 Index approached correction territory, down over 10%, but recovered to a 4% decline by Friday. VIX index saw dramatic fluctuations, spiking to 65.73 on Monday—its highest level since late March 2020—before settling at 20.69 by the week’s end. These movements were influenced by technical factors and programmed trading strategies from carry trading. A recent increase in Japanese short-term interest rates contributed to a partial unwinding of the carry trade. The yen’s sharp rise over the previous weeks rendered the trade unprofitable, prompting many investors sell-off. Despite these challenges, short covering and stock buybacks provided some support to the index this week.</p>
<br>

<p><strong>In the bond market, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury rose over the week, although fears of a weakening labor market eased following a reassuring drop in weekly jobless claims on Thursday</strong> Positive indicators for market liquidity were also noted, with assets in the Fed’s overnight reverse repo facility falling to their lowest level in more than three years, suggesting improved funding market conditions and prompting users to move more cash away from the central bank.</p>
<br>

<p><strong>Economic Data</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p>The S&amp;P gauge of services sector activity dipped slightly to 55.5 in July from 56.0 in June but remained firmly in expansion territory.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Institute for Supply Management’s measure rebounded from a contractionary 48.8 in June.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Weekly jobless claims decreased to 233,000 from a revised 250,000, though continuing claims saw a modest rise of 6,000, reaching 1.875 million.</p>

<h3 id="EU-Market"><a href="#EU-Market" class="headerlink" title="EU Market :"></a>EU Market :<br><br></h3><p><strong>The EU markets outperformed this week with positive gains, benefiting from lower volatility amid the broader sell-off and encouraging signs for the European economy.</strong> The pan-European STOXX Europe 600 Index recovered from earlier losses, ending 0.27% higher. Major stock indexes displayed mixed results: Germany’s DAX gained 0.35%, France’s CAC 40 Index rose 0.25%, while the UK’s FTSE 100 Index remained largely unchanged. Conversely, Italy’s FTSE MIB experienced a decline of 0.74%.</p>
<br>

<p><strong>Eurozone government bond yields generally increased, rebounding from their earlier lows as global market concerns about economic growth were mitigated by relatively favorable EU economic data.</strong> The positive U.S. jobless claims report helped ease these concerns, which had been heightened by disappointing U.S. manufacturing and employment data. In Germany, industrial output rose by 1.4% in June, and industrial orders increased by 3.9% on a seasonally and calendar-adjusted basis, both surpassing expectations. In the UK, housing market sentiment showed cautious improvement in July, supported by lower interest rates and the new Labour government’s commitment to enhancing residential development.</p>

<h3 id="Asian-Market"><a href="#Asian-Market" class="headerlink" title="Asian Market :"></a>Asian Market :<br><br></h3><p><strong>In the Japanese stock market, the week mirrored the turbulence experienced in the US, with a sharp decline on Monday followed by stabilization in the subsequent days.</strong> Japan’s markets endured their most severe one-day sell-off in decades, triggered by a rebounding yen after BoJ hawkish stance at its July meeting. The BoJ raised interest rates and announced plans to taper its bond purchases, leading to a global sell-off from carry trade strategies. The volatility in Japan’s market, which had global repercussions, was somewhat mitigated by dovish remarks from BoJ Deputy Governor Shinichi Uchida. He indicated that the central bank would refrain from raising interest rates during periods of market instability, reducing the likelihood of a near-term hike. The bond market also responded to Uchida’s comments, with the yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond falling to 0.86% from 0.98% at the end of the previous week as investors evaluated the BoJ’s monetary policy outlook.</p>
<br>

<p><strong>In China, the stock market retreated as stronger-than-expected consumer price increases did not alleviate concerns about deflationary pressures.</strong> The Shanghai Composite Index declined by 1.48%, while the blue-chip CSI 300 fell by 1.56%. China’s consumer price index rose by 0.5% in July compared to a year earlier, up from June’s 0.2% increase. Analysts attributed the rise to seasonal factors, including adverse weather conditions and a low base for pork prices in 2023. Additionally, the Caixin composite purchasing managers’ index (PMI) softened to 51.2 from 52.8 in June, with the Caixin manufacturing PMI contracting unexpectedly for the first time in nine months the previous week.</p>
<br>

<p><strong>Economic Data :</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p>China’s July consumer prices rise more than expected, producer prices remains deflationary</p>
</li>
<li><p>China’s trade surplus below estimates as exports disappoint, imports grow more than estimated</p>
</li>
<li><p>Asia stocks rebound after global market selloff, Japan’s Nikkei sees best day since October 2008</p>
</li>
<li><p>China’s services PMI expands more than expected in July amid robust demand conditions</p>

<h3 id="Other-Markets"><a href="#Other-Markets" class="headerlink" title="Other Markets :"></a>Other Markets :<br><br></h3><p>The Japanese yen depreciated at 146.58 per dollar, approaching a one-week low as the dollar strengthened. <strong>This move was supported by better-than-expected US jobless claims data, which alleviated recession concerns, and comments from the Bank of Japan following the recent sell-off turbulence.</strong> Similarly, the dollar index maintained its recent gains, holding around 103.2 on Friday and staying near a one-week high.</p>
<br>

<p><strong>WTI crude oil futures rose by 0.8% to settle at $76.80 per barrel on Friday, marking a gain of over 4% for the week—the first weekly increase in five.</strong> This rise was driven by favorable economic data and indications from Federal Reserve officials that a rate cut might be considered as early as September, easing some demand concerns. Additionally, fears of escalating conflicts in the Middle East contributed to supply risks, further supporting the price increase. Crude prices also benefited from Wednesday’s data, which showed a larger-than-expected drop in weekly EIA crude inventories, reaching a six-month low.</p>
<br>

<p><strong>Gold prices eased to around $2,430 per ounce on Friday.</strong> Despite this, gold continues to attract interest due to ongoing geopolitical risks and expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut. The metal’s safe-haven appeal has been bolstered by escalating geopolitical tensions, including anticipated retaliatory actions by Iran against Israel and a rare Ukrainian strike on Russia.</p>
