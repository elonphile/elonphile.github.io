[{"title":"Metals Recap - Diverse Dynamics Amid Economic and Geopolitical Shifts","url":"/2024/01/01/metal_jan01/","content":"\n# Summary\n\n- **This week, the base metal market presented a diverse picture, influenced by macroeconomic trends and geopolitical events. Copper prices dipped slightly in the US, impacted by a stronger dollar and cooling labor market, while in China, supply disruptions were offset by year-end inventory releases. Aluminum found support in the EU and US from potential Fed interest rate cuts, indicated by lower economic indicators. Zinc and nickel, however, faced contrasting fortunes.** \n\n- **Zinc prices were subdued due to seasonal slowdowns and were further dampened by deliveries to LME warehouses. Nickel contended with the dual challenges of geopolitical tensions in the Red Sea and an increased supply, leading to a cautious short-term outlook. Overall, the base metal market was characterized by cautious trading and region-specific responses to global economic and geopolitical developments.** \n\n<br>\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n### Copper :\n\n### <br><br>\n\n**In the last week of December, copper prices faced a slight decline in the US due to a rebound in the dollar index and cooling labor market, while in China, disruptions in supply were offset by year-end inventory clearances, but weakened demand and a lower PMI kept the market under pressure.** \n\n\n\n**European and US Markets :** \n\n<br>\n\nThe week began quietly with the London Metal Exchange (LME) and Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) closed for the Christmas holiday on Monday. The absence of significant overseas news during the holiday season put the markets in a wait-and-see mode initially.\n\n<br>\n\nPost-holiday, market sentiment was buoyed by expectations that the United States might start reducing interest rates soon. This anticipation led to a dip in the U.S. dollar index, generally a bullish signal for copper prices. However, the week also brought some concerns. The U.S. reported 218,000 initial jobless claims for the week ending December 23, higher than the forecasted 210,000. This indicates a cooling labor market, which, while potentially pointing to future interest rate cuts, did not immediately bolster copper prices.\n\n<br>\n\nMid-week, the U.S. dollar index rebounded due to investors closing their currency positions towards year-end, which applied downward pressure on copper prices. The week concluded with a modest 0.39% decline in CME's March 2024 copper futures. \n\n<br>\n\n**China's Market Dynamics :**\n\n<br>\n\nIn China, supply-side dynamics were affected by shipping schedule disruptions in certain regions, leading to anticipated delays in imported copper arrivals. This could mean a reduced supply of imported copper in the latter half of the week. Despite this, domestic sellers, aiming to clear year-end inventories, released substantial copper quantities into the market, balancing the supply equation.\n\n<br>\n\nOn the demand side, however, the pressure remained downwards. The final week of the year typically sees muted activity as companies engage in year-end settlements and only purchase as needed. This weak consumption trend was reflected in Shanghai copper's performance, which dropped in a lackluster market.\n\n<br>\n\nThe overall supply of copper remained stable, but high copper prices and significant discounts did not sufficiently stimulate downstream purchasing. The domestic Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for December stood at 49.0%, a 0.4 percentage point decrease from November, signaling a dip in manufacturing prosperity. This, coupled with the expected continued weak consumption, is likely to keep copper prices under pressure. \n\n\n\n<br><br>\n\n### Aluminum :\n\n### <br><br>\n\n**EU and US Markets :**\n\n<br>\n\nIn the United States, the core PCE price index's annual rate for November came in below expectations, indicating a more significant cooling in inflation than anticipated. This data, coupled with the downward revision of the actual GDP for the third quarter and consumption figures falling short of expectations, has bolstered expectations that the Federal Reserve might consider interest rate cuts. This potential policy shift has provided support to aluminum prices, as lower interest rates can boost economic activity and demand for commodities like aluminum.\n\n<br>\n\n**China Market :**\n\n<br>\n\nDespite ongoing weak demand, the traditional off-season in China is impacting the aluminum market. Companies are focusing on cash flow towards the year's end, leading to reduced interest in restocking. It is expected that the reduction in aluminum ingot social inventory will decelerate, but overall inventory levels are likely to remain low. On the domestic macroeconomic front, the situation appears positive. Major state-owned banks have reduced deposit interest rates, which can stimulate economic activity.\n\n<br>\n\nFrom the supply side, low stocks and raw material support are expected to keep aluminum prices firm in the short term. Especially,aluminum can be more sensitive to energy costs and electricity prices, compared to copper, more sensitive to the overall economic health.  Additionally, recent complications in the Red Sea impacting transportation costs, and power load management in Qinghai Province due to earthquake relief efforts, might affect aluminum supply, further supporting prices.\n\n<br>\n\nThe Shanghai Futures Exchange (SHFE) market was closed during the last Friday night session. On the London Metal Exchange (LME), aluminum opened at 2,368/mt last Friday, reaching highs and lows of 2,394.5/mt and 2,363/mt, respectively, before closing at 2,387.5/mt. This closing figure represents an increase of$20.5/mt or 0.87%. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) aluminum saw a notable gain of 2.83% over the week.\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n### Zinc :\n\n### <br><br>\n\n**The performance of zinc last week closely mirrored that of copper.** The week saw interruptions in trading due to holidays, with the LME closed on Monday for Christmas and the SHFE zinc market shut on Friday for New Year's Day, including a suspension of night trading.\n\n<br>\n\nIn this context, SHFE zinc struggled to gain upward momentum, reflecting the impact of the off-season. The prices frequently retraced, aligning with the average levels of the preceding workdays. However, growing market optimism about a potential U.S. interest rate cut as early as March fueled bullish sentiments. This was further amplified by the declining U.S. dollar index, which generally bolsters commodity prices.\n\n<br>\n\nDespite this optimism, zinc prices on the LME were restrained. Deliveries to LME warehouses tempered the market's enthusiasm, resulting in a lack of significant upward movement for LME zinc. On the last trading day of the week, LME zinc opened at 2,634/ton, dipping to a low of 2,629/ton. However, during the night trading session, it reached a peak of US$2,675/ton before closing at 2,662/ton, up by 35/ton or 1.33%. Trading volume slightly decreased by 8 lots to 6,880 lots, while open interest saw a notable increase of 3,969 lots to 201,000 lots. Notably, LME zinc inventories rose by 2,700 tons to 224,825 tons, marking an increase of 1.22%.\n\n<br><br>\n\n### Nickel :<br><br>\n\n**The increased supply, combined with geopolitical uncertainties and fluctuating raw material prices, points towards a potentially volatile market environment.**\n\n<br>\n\nIn the current macroeconomic landscape, geopolitical tensions are significantly influencing the nickel market. The recent escalation of the Red Sea crisis, stemming from the conflict between US military forces and Houthi armed forces on December 31, 2023, has heightened concerns over transportation disruptions in the Red Sea and Eurasian regions. This situation has the potential to increase market risk aversion, as the uncertainty around supply routes intensifies.\n\n<br>\n\nDespite these geopolitical challenges, the dynamics within the nickel market itself reveal a complex picture. The London Metal Exchange (LME) has reported a continuous accumulation of nickel inventory, particularly in Asian warehouses. This suggests a somewhat buffered supply, even in the face of potential transportation challenges.\n\n<br>\n\nFurthermore, the downward pricing trend in nickel sulphate and other raw materials, along with the recent lateral movement in SHFE (Shanghai Futures Exchange) nickel prices, has brought a notable shift. Refined nickel producers, who had previously been operating at a loss, are now seeing a return to profitability. Concurrently, some smelters have resumed normal production levels, indicating an anticipated increase in supply. Given these factors, the short-term outlook for nickel suggests a potential for downside pressure. \n\n<br><br>\n\n---\n\n| Future   | Friday's Close | Week's Change | YTD   |\n| -------- |:--------------:|:-------------:|:-----:|\n| Copper   | 3.88           | -0.39         | 1.97  |\n| Aluminum | 2,332.25       | 2.83          | -3.24 |\n| Zinc LME | 2,662          | -             | -     |\n| Nickel   |                |               |       |\n","tags":["Weekly Recap","Metals"],"categories":["Markets"]},{"title":"A Playlist for Imagine Dragons","url":"/2023/12/31/playlist_dec31/","content":"\n# \n\n# \"Music has the power to move the soul\n\n# Imagine Dragons' anthems ignite the fire within.\"\n\n<br>\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n### <br><br>\n\n## Playlist\n\n\"Symphony\"\n\n\"Natural\"\n\n\"Bones\"  \n\n\"Believer\" \n\n\"Thunder\" \n\n\"On Top of the World\" \n\n\"Enemy\" \n\n\"Sharks\" \n\n\"Higher Ground\" \n\n\"Only\" \n\n\"Love\" \n\n---\n\n### \n","tags":["Playlist"],"categories":["Beyond"]},{"title":"Markets Recap - Diverse Trends Define Year-End Landscape","url":"/2023/12/30/macro_dec30/","content":"\n# Summary\n\n- **Global markets present a mixed picture.

In the US market, major benchmark stock indices experienced a mixed performance during this holiday week, signaling the conclusion of a robust year. The S&P 500 index notably extended its winning streak, notching its ninth consecutive weekly gain. However, with the holiday spirit in full swing and trading halted on Monday, the overall market activity remained subdued as many investors were away from their desks.<br>\n\n**Quiet Bond Markets Amid Festivities.** Shifting focus to the bond markets, US treasuries rallied on Wednesday, propelled by strong interest in this year's auction. Despite the holiday-induced quietude, investors showcased a preference for risk assets, aligning with the evolving tone of monetary policies.<br>\n\n**Economic Data** \n\n- The index of manufacturing activity witnessed a substantial decline in December, signaling the potential for further contraction.\n\n- Business activity in the Chicago region dipped into contraction territory, reflecting broader economic challenges.\n\n- Home sales fell short of expectations evend given a drop in mortgage interest rates. \n\n- Jobless claims unexpectedly rose, adding an unforeseen level of concern for the month.\n\n<br>\n\n| Index   | Friday's Close | Week's Change | YTD   |\n| ------- |:--------------:|:-------------:|:-----:|\n| S&P 500 | 4,769.83       | -0.28         | 24.23 |\n| DJIA    | 37,689.54      | -0.05         | 13.70 |\n| Nasdaq  | 15,011.35      | -0.56         | 43.20 |\n| Russell | 2,027.07       | -1.52         | 15.09 |\n\n<br><br>\n\n### EU Market :<br><br>\n\n**EU Stocks Reach New Heights Amid Rate Cut Expectations** The STOXX Euro 600 surged to nearly two-year highs, registering a 0.31% gain on the back of heightened expectations for early-year interest rate cuts. However, the regional indices presented a mixed picture as Germany's DAX posted a 0.22% increase, while Italy's FTSE MIB and France's CAC 40 remained relatively unchanged. Meanwhile, the UK's FTSE 100 saw a notable rise of 0.6%.<br>\n\n**Quiet Bond Markets Anticipate ECB's Caution** In the bond markets, the week unfolded with a tranquil ambiance. The European Central Bank (ECB) is expected to refrain from raising interest rates, driven by concerns over cooling inflation and the looming possibility of a recession. This anticipation has contributed to the subdued nature of the bond markets during the week.<br>\n\n**Economic Data**\n\n- Headline prices decelerating, particularly in Spain, where the rate eased to 3.1% in December. \n\n- The Nationwide Building Society's house price index in the UK remained unchanged sequentially in December, marking a substantial 1.8% year-on-year decline—the most significant annual dip since 2008. This underscores challenges in the UK's housing market and hints at broader economic concerns.\n\n<br>\n\n| Index       | Friday's Close | Week's Change | YTD   |\n| ----------- |:--------------:|:-------------:|:-----:|\n| STOXX 600   | 479.02         | 0.3           | 12.74 |\n| Germany DAX | 16,751.64      | 0.27          | 20.31 |\n| France CAC  | 7,543.18       | -0,34         | 16.52 |\n| UK FTSE     | 7733.2         | 0.46          | 3.78  |\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n### Asian Market :<br><br>\n\n**Japan's Market Climbs** Japan's stock markets concluded the week on a positive note, with the Nikkei 225 Index rising by 0.89%. The impetus behind this gain was the anticipation of the Bank of Japan (BOJ) maintaining its ultralow interest rate policy. Remarkably, the Nikkei marked its most substantial annual gains since 2013, recording a 28% surge in 2023, solidifying its position as the best-performing index in Asia.<br>\n\n**Chinese Markets Rally** In China, markets saw a robust uptick in the final week. The government's announcement of new online game approvals and assurances against a potential gaming sector clampdown from the previous week buoyed investor confidence. The Shanghai Composite Index gained 2.06%, and the blue-chip CSI 300 added 2.81%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index also surged, advancing by an impressive 4.33%.\n\n<br>\n\n| Index     | Friday's Close | Week's Change | YTD    |\n| --------- |:--------------:|:-------------:|:------:|\n| NIKKEI    | 33,464.17      | 0.89          | 28.24  |\n| CSI 300   | 3,341.11       | 2.81          | -11.38 |\n| Hang Seng | 17,047.39      | 4.33          | -13.82 |\n\n<br><br>\n\n### Other Markets :<br><br>\n\nIn other markets, on Friday, the Brent crude oil price held its ground at $77.41 per barrel, showcasing a modest 0.34% decline from the preceding day.\n\n<br><br>\n\n---\n","tags":["Macro","Weekly Recap"],"categories":["Markets"]},{"title":"Markets Recap - Peaks,Valleys,and Puzzles","url":"/2023/12/23/macro_dec23/","content":"\n# Summary\n\n- **Global Optimism and Economic Concerns:** **Markets around the world experienced record highs, with the U.S. and European equities reaching new peaks.

Investor confidence grew as concerns about an impending recession diminished. Notably, the S&P500 surged by 84 basis points, with communication services stocks, including Alphabet and Meta Platforms, playing a pivotal role in supporting this advancement.<br>\n\n**The U.S. bonds market witnessed further gains**, accompanied by a decline in short-term bond yields. The Federal Reserve's comments during the week, hinting at potential interest rate cuts in the coming year, influenced market dynamics. However, the Fed expressed worries about the economy slowing down too rapidly, particularly in light of a sharp increase in the unemployment rate. Data from the week supported these concerns, with core PCE rising only 0.1% in November, marking the first decline in headline PCE since 2021. Other notable data included surprising figures in home sales, housing starts, and a significant 8% increase in orders for non-defense capital goods – the largest since 2004.<br><br>\n\n### EU Market :<br><br>\n\n**Parallel trends like US.** European markets mirrored the positive sentiment seen in the U.S., with the European Stoxx 600 rising by 20 basis points to maintain a one-year high. The UK's index saw a 1% gain as inflation cooled down. However, concerns loomed over the economy's proximity to recession, as reflected in the lowered GDP forecast. German companies showed increased pessimism due to continued shrinkage in their order books.<br><br>\n\n### Asian Market :<br><br>\n\n**Japan maintains stability.** Japan's markets experienced modest gains or remained largely unchanged, thanks to support from a more dovish Bank of Japan (BOJ). The BOJ provided forward guidance during the December meeting but refrained from commenting on potential monetary policy tweaks, in contrast to the previous week. The initial weakening of the yen and a decline in the bond market to 0.62% from 0.7% last week were notable.\n\n**China faces market headwinds.** China's stock market witnessed a decline, primarily attributed to new restrictions on the gaming sector. The Shanghai Composite Index dropped by almost 1%, erasing nearly $80 billion in market value. Investors expressed concerns about future earnings and a potential regulatory crackdown, reminiscent of actions taken against tech companies two years ago. Anticipation of further easing by the People's Bank of China (PBOC) in 2024 added to the market uncertainty, driven by deflationary pressures on the economy.<br><br>\n\n### Other Markets :<br><br>\n\n**Oil prices surge amidst red sea concerns.** Global oil prices surged as investor concerns heightened over attacks on shipping in the Red Sea.

Small caps outperformed, surging by 5%. Trading volumes were notably elevated towards the end of the week, reaching a new high for the year. The VIX, often referred to as the fear gauge, dropped to its lowest level post-pandemic.<br>\n\n**Key economic indicators supported a positive market sentiment. The Tuesday report on consumer price inflation aligned with expectations, showing a year-over-year rate of 4%. The Federal Reserve (FED) kept interest rates unchanged as anticipated and gave no indication of pushing back against market expectations for aggressive cuts next year. Retail sales for November unexpectedly rose by 0.3%, though this could be attributed to the holiday season. However, manufacturing sector data hinted at potential disappointments.<br>\n\nThe 10-year Treasury bond yield fell to 4%, a level not seen since July. This drop was influenced by signals from the FED, indicating a cooling inflation and more dovish stance. In this risk-on environment, corporate bonds outperformed.<br><br>\n\n### EU Market :<br><br>\n\nIn Europe, the Stoxx Europe 600 ended 1% higher. However, major indices showed mixed performance, with France outperforming the UK and Germany. The European Central Bank (ECB) left interest rates relatively unchanged but lowered its inflation and growth forecasts for 2023, projecting 2% in 2026. The ECB also announced plans to phase out the reinvestment of maturing securities in its emergency pandemic program, signaling a reduction in bond purchases and reinvestments.<br>\n\nBusiness activity in the Eurozone continued to contract, as indicated by the PMI for manufacturing and service sectors remaining below 50 for the seventh consecutive month. In the UK, GDP remained flat for the three months ending October.<br><br>\n\n### Asian Market :<br><br>\n\nJapan's stock market saw a 2% surge in the Nikkei, supported by signals of interest rate cuts from the FED. However, the strengthening yen could pose challenges for exporters due to expectations of narrowing U.S.-Japan interest rate differentials. Bond yields fell to 0.7% due to investor sentiment on the Bank of Japan's policy pivot. PMI data showed a mild expansion in Japan's private sector business activity, but a political scandal involving the ruling party impacted its popularity.<br>\n\nThe Chinese stock market experienced a decline due to deflationary pressures, with CPI continuing to decline by 0.5% compared to the previous year. Concerns about deflation triggering an economic downturn led to market worries. Other economic indicators presented mixed results, with industrial output growing, retail sales surging by 10%, and fixed asset investment rising, though it missed expectations. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) injected 1 billion into the banking system, but lending rates remained unchanged, prompting speculation that the PBOC may intensify policy support to bolster the economy.<br><br>\n\n### Other Markets :<br><br>\n\nIn other markets, Treasury yields rose, pushing the 10-year yield below 4%. The U.S. dollar fell against all its developed-market peers, driven partly by gains in the euro and pound following signals from the European Central Bank that they are not in a hurry to join the U.S. in interest rate cuts.<br>\n\nOil held steady in a lukewarm session following concerns that supplies are outpacing demand, leading to the longest weekly losing streak in five years.<br>\n\n---\n\n### \n","tags":["Macro","Weekly Recap"],"categories":["Markets"]}]
