Anticipation of further easing by the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) in 2024 added to the market uncertainty, driven by deflationary pressures on the economy.<br><br></p>\n<h3 id=\"Other-Markets\"><a href=\"#Other-Markets\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Other Markets :\"></a>Other Markets :<br><br></h3><p><strong>Oil prices surge amidst red sea concerns.</strong> Global oil prices surged as investor concerns heightened over attacks on shipping in the Red Sea.

The absence of significant overseas news during the holiday season put the markets in a wait-and-see mode initially.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>Post-holiday, market sentiment was buoyed by expectations that the United States might start reducing interest rates soon. This anticipation led to a dip in the U.S. dollar index, generally a bullish signal for copper prices. However, the week also brought some concerns. The U.S. reported 218,000 initial jobless claims for the week ending December 23, higher than the forecasted 210,000. This indicates a cooling labor market, which, while potentially pointing to future interest rate cuts, did not immediately bolster copper prices.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>Mid-week, the U.S. dollar index rebounded due to investors closing their currency positions towards year-end, which applied downward pressure on copper prices. The week concluded with a modest 0.39% decline in CME’s March 2024 copper futures. </p>\n<br>\n\n<p><strong>China’s Market Dynamics :</strong></p>\n<br>\n\n<p>In China, supply-side dynamics were affected by shipping schedule disruptions in certain regions, leading to anticipated delays in imported copper arrivals. This could mean a reduced supply of imported copper in the latter half of the week. Despite this, domestic sellers, aiming to clear year-end inventories, released substantial copper quantities into the market, balancing the supply equation.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>On the demand side, however, the pressure remained downwards. The final week of the year typically sees muted activity as companies engage in year-end settlements and only purchase as needed. This weak consumption trend was reflected in Shanghai copper’s performance, which dropped in a lackluster market.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>The overall supply of copper remained stable, but high copper prices and significant discounts did not sufficiently stimulate downstream purchasing. The domestic Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for December stood at 49.0%, a 0.4 percentage point decrease from November, signaling a dip in manufacturing prosperity. This, coupled with the expected continued weak consumption, is likely to keep copper prices under pressure. </p>\n<p><br><br></p>\n<h3 id=\"Aluminum\"><a href=\"#Aluminum\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Aluminum :\"></a>Aluminum :</h3><p><strong>EU and US Markets :</strong></p>\n<br>\n\n<p>In the United States, the core PCE price index’s annual rate for November came in below expectations, indicating a more significant cooling in inflation than anticipated. This data, coupled with the downward revision of the actual GDP for the third quarter and consumption figures falling short of expectations, has bolstered expectations that the Federal Reserve might consider interest rate cuts. This potential policy shift has provided support to aluminum prices, as lower interest rates can boost economic activity and demand for commodities like aluminum.<br></p>\n<p><strong>China Market :</strong></p>\n<br>\n\n<p>Despite ongoing weak demand, the traditional off-season in China is impacting the aluminum market. Companies are focusing on cash flow towards the year’s end, leading to reduced interest in restocking. It is expected that the reduction in aluminum ingot social inventory will decelerate, but overall inventory levels are likely to remain low. On the domestic macroeconomic front, the situation appears positive. Major state-owned banks have reduced deposit interest rates, which can stimulate economic activity.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>From the supply side, low stocks and raw material support are expected to keep aluminum prices firm in the short term. Especially,aluminum can be more sensitive to energy costs and electricity prices, compared to copper, more sensitive to the overall economic health.  Additionally, recent complications in the Red Sea impacting transportation costs, and power load management in Qinghai Province due to earthquake relief efforts, might affect aluminum supply, further supporting prices.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>The Shanghai Futures Exchange (SHFE) market was closed during the last Friday night session. On the London Metal Exchange (LME), aluminum opened at 2,368&#x2F;mt last Friday, reaching highs and lows of 2,394.5&#x2F;mt and 2,363&#x2F;mt, respectively, before closing at 2,387.5&#x2F;mt. This closing figure represents an increase of$20.5&#x2F;mt or 0.87%. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) aluminum saw a notable gain of 2.83% over the week.</p>\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3 id=\"Zinc\"><a href=\"#Zinc\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Zinc :\"></a>Zinc :</h3><p><strong>The performance of zinc last week closely mirrored that of copper.</strong> The week saw interruptions in trading due to holidays, with the LME closed on Monday for Christmas and the SHFE zinc market shut on Friday for New Year’s Day, including a suspension of night trading.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>In this context, SHFE zinc struggled to gain upward momentum, reflecting the impact of the off-season. The prices frequently retraced, aligning with the average levels of the preceding workdays. However, growing market optimism about a potential U.S. interest rate cut as early as March fueled bullish sentiments. This was further amplified by the declining U.S. dollar index, which generally bolsters commodity prices.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>Despite this optimism, zinc prices on the LME were restrained. Deliveries to LME warehouses tempered the market’s enthusiasm, resulting in a lack of significant upward movement for LME zinc. On the last trading day of the week, LME zinc opened at 2,634&#x2F;ton, dipping to a low of 2,629&#x2F;ton. However, during the night trading session, it reached a peak of US$2,675&#x2F;ton before closing at 2,662&#x2F;ton, up by 35&#x2F;ton or 1.33%. Trading volume slightly decreased by 8 lots to 6,880 lots, while open interest saw a notable increase of 3,969 lots to 201,000 lots. Notably, LME zinc inventories rose by 2,700 tons to 224,825 tons, marking an increase of 1.22%.</p>\n<p><br><br></p>\n<h3 id=\"Nickel\"><a href=\"#Nickel\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Nickel :\"></a>Nickel :</h3><p><strong>The increased supply, combined with geopolitical uncertainties and fluctuating raw material prices, points towards a potentially volatile market environment.</strong></p>\n<br>\n\n<p>In the current macroeconomic landscape, geopolitical tensions are significantly influencing the nickel market. The recent escalation of the Red Sea crisis, stemming from the conflict between US military forces and Houthi armed forces on December 31, 2023, has heightened concerns over transportation disruptions in the Red Sea and Eurasian regions. This situation has the potential to increase market risk aversion, as the uncertainty around supply routes intensifies.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>Despite these geopolitical challenges, the dynamics within the nickel market itself reveal a complex picture. The London Metal Exchange (LME) has reported a continuous accumulation of nickel inventory, particularly in Asian warehouses. This suggests a somewhat buffered supply, even in the face of potential transportation challenges.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the downward pricing trend in nickel sulphate and other raw materials, along with the recent lateral movement in SHFE (Shanghai Futures Exchange) nickel prices, has brought a notable shift. Refined nickel producers, who had previously been operating at a loss, are now seeing a return to profitability. Concurrently, some smelters have resumed normal production levels, indicating an anticipated increase in supply. Given these factors, the short-term outlook for nickel suggests a potential for downside pressure. </p>\n<p><br><br></p>\n<hr>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Future</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Friday’s Close</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Weekly</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Monthly</th>\n<th align=\"center\">YTD</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Copper</td>\n<td align=\"center\">3.79</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-2.45</td>\n<td align=\"center\">1.87</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-3.21</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Aluminum</td>\n<td align=\"center\">2274.50</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-4.59</td>\n<td align=\"center\">5.86</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-0.91</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Zinc</td>\n<td align=\"center\">2550.00</td>\n<td align=\"center\">–4.06</td>\n<td align=\"center\">5.00</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-15.66</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Nickel</td>\n<td align=\"center\">15835</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-4.02</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-0.66</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-42.62</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cobalt</td>\n<td align=\"center\">29135</td>\n<td align=\"center\">0</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-12.82</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-41.73</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>LME Index</td>\n<td align=\"center\">3670.30</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-2.89</td>\n<td align=\"center\">2.35</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-6.02</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>SSE Con</td>\n<td align=\"center\">8685.58</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-3.70</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-4.48</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-22.23</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Freignt Index</td>\n<td align=\"center\">1759.57</td>\n<td align=\"center\">40.21</td>\n<td align=\"center\">74.08</td>\n<td align=\"center\">58.87</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<br>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Electricity</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Friday’s Close</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Weekly</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Monthly</th>\n<th align=\"center\">YTD</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>UK</td>\n<td align=\"center\">86.85</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-0.06</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-3.06</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-52.17</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Germany</td>\n<td align=\"center\">88.72</td>\n<td align=\"center\">160.48</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-23.91</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-0.10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>France</td>\n<td align=\"center\">90.25</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-2.70</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-8.89</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-58.90</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Italy</td>\n<td align=\"center\">91.17</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-9.93</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-31.65</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-50.43</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Spain</td>\n<td align=\"center\">91.36</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-6.96</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-19.25</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-16.32</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n","categories":["Markets"],"tags":["Weekly Recap","Metals"]},{"title":"Metals Recap - Diverse Dynamics Amid Economic and Geopolitical Shifts","url":"/2024/01/01/metal_jan01/","content":"<h1 id=\"Summary\"><a href=\"#Summary\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Summary\"></a>Summary</h1><ul>\n<li><p><strong>This week, the base metal market presented a diverse picture, influenced by macroeconomic trends and geopolitical events.
