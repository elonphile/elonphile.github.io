[{"title":"Book Review - Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned","url":"/2024/01/01/bookreview_jan08/","content":"<h1 id=\"\"><a href=\"#\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"\"></a></h1><style>\n</style>\n\n<h2 id=\"Book-info\"><a href=\"#Book-info\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Book info\"></a>Book info</h2><br>\n\n<p>《Why Greatness Cannot Be Plannede》by Kenneth O. Stanley and Joel Lehman. This book challenges the conventional wisdom that setting specific goals is the key to achieving success. It introduces us to the concept of ‘novelty search,’ which essentially suggests that innovation and greatness might just stem from an unstructured exploration of our passions, rather than from chasing pre-set objectives. <strong><u>It’s like what we often say: Keep your passion alive and live your life without limits.</u></strong></p>\n<br>\n\n<h2 id=\"Content\"><a href=\"#Content\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Content\"></a>Content</h2><br>\n\n<p>This book starts by contrasting goal-oriented thinking with a more open-ended, passion-driven exploration. The initial chapters bring in various examples to illustrate how a non-objective-driven approach could be more effective, particularly in complex<br>and unpredictable scenarios. By Chapter 4, the book posits that having very specific goals might actually limit our potential and cause us to miss out on unforeseen opportunities. This is because overly complex and unprecedented goals are hard to measure, akin to predicting a path in a Markov chain - you can’t know the past routes, but you understand that certain prerequisites need to exist for the desired outcome. Essentially, only those who are well-prepared and knowledgeable can seize these opportunities when they arise.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>In the subsequent chapters, the authors liken this process to being a treasure hunter, constantly reveling in the discovery of new things. Life is full of ups and downs, and people often wish for a restart, to see things from a different perspective. Imagine if life was a game where you could restart infinitely – the fastest path might seem appealing, but it would also strip away the element of surprise and discovery. The book’s later chapters showcase real-world case studies where a novelty search approach led to significant breakthroughs across various fields. </p>\n<br>\n\n<p><strong><u>The real message: Work hard, work smart, and with a bit of luck, you might meet serendipity.</u></strong></p>\n<br>\n\n<h2 id=\"Analysis-and-Critique\"><a href=\"#Analysis-and-Critique\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Analysis and Critique\"></a>Analysis and Critique</h2><br>\n\n<p>To be honest, I’m not entirely on board with the authors’ emphasis on the dichotomy between aimlessness and goal-setting. <strong><u>While I don’t advocate for a completely aimless approach, I do believe in setting broader, less specific long-term goals.</u></strong> For instance, the authors often mention that greatness is ‘accidental.’ In my view, the goals and methods we set are bound by our present understanding, rooted in past experiences. However, as we progress and evolve, our approaches may change, leading to outcomes that are different – and sometimes ‘accidental’ – compared to our original intentions. This suggests that we should aim for broad goals, remaining flexible in our journey.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>Another example they use interpretation of natural evolution. While the authors see diversity as a way to avoid competition which he called “none goal for survival “, I believe it’s more about the broader goal of survival and reproduction. If we were to ‘restart’ life on Earth, humans might look completely different – like creatures from ‘Avatar’ or another alien species – as long as we’re suited to survive. Under this broad goal, species evolve and diversify. So, there’s always a goal, albeit not a highly specific one. Maybe It’s about pursuing happiness or value, but exploring and discovering like treasure hunters on a path towards the best possible outcomes.</p>\n<p><br><u><strong>In summary, I want to apply the concept of ‘golden mean’  for this book, I recommedate this book for a balance between short-term practical objectives and long-term, vague ambitions. It’s about holding onto your long-term goals while being open to abandoning unsuitable new ventures. The journey might be confusing or surprising at times, but that’s the essence of life.</strong> </u></p>\n<br>\n\n<p><u><strong>May you a journey filled with wonderful discoveries!</strong> </u></p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"-1\"><a href=\"#-1\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"\"></a></h3>","categories":["Beyond"],"tags":["BookReview"]},{"title":"Booklist for Jan","url":"/2024/01/01/booklist_jan/","content":"<h1 id=\"Top-Picks\"><a href=\"#Top-Picks\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Top Picks\"></a>Top Picks</h1><h1 id=\"Reade’s-choice\"><a href=\"#Reade’s-choice\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Reade’s choice\"></a>Reade’s choice</h1><ul>\n<li><p>《  Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned 》by Kenneth O.

This retreat was influenced by a resurgence in the US dollar, which exerted downward pressure on commodity prices. Additionally, profit-taking activities by commodity trading firms contributed to the dip in copper futures. The subdued demand from China further exacerbated the situation, marked by a fourth consecutive month of low Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) readings according to Caixin data. These factors collectively contributed to the weakening of copper prices in the market. </p>\n<br>\n\n<p><strong>Aluminum retreats on supply enhancement, investments, and PBOC support.</strong>  Aluminum futures dropped below 2300 from the eight-month high of 2387 last week in 2023. The earlier surge was due to a bauxite supply disruption from Guinea, the world’s third-largest bauxite exporter. An explosion at a fuel depot in Guinea halted industrial activity, driving aluminum prices up. The recent retreat can be attributed to strong investments from the UAE in the infrastructure sector, alleviating investor concerns. Additionally, the People’s Bank of China’s (PBOC) policy to inject 350 billion into state banks is expected to bolster manufacturing activity, providing short-term support to aluminum prices.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p><strong>Nickel futures dip on oversupply concerns.</strong> Nickel futures fell below $16,500 per tonne, nearing three-year lows, due to abundant supply from top producers—Indonesia, Philippines, and China. The International Nickel Study Group forecasts a surplus of 223,000 metric tons in 2023, with expectations of widening to 239,000 metric tons in 2024, emphasizing the persistent imbalance between supply and demand in the nickel market.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p><strong>Tin dips on dollar strength, easing supply.</strong> Tin futures experienced a dip in the first week, influenced by a strengthening dollar and easing supply concerns from the previous year, following a three-month high of $25,680 reached on December 28th. Despite the decline, tin prices were upheld by the prolonged production halt in Myanmar’s Wa region since August, responsible for 70% of Myanmar’s output and a significant portion of China’s tin supply. With China compelled to seek alternative sources, the Republic of Congo became a primary supplier. However, adverse weather conditions and infrastructure challenges in Congo towards the end of the year hampered output, contributing to elevated tin prices in the market.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p><strong>Lithium remained unchanged this week in such restocking season.</strong> Lithium carbonate prices, hitting CNY 97,500 per tonne in January, marked the lowest since August 2021, plummeting over 80% in the past year due to an escalating oversupply. Pessimism surrounding electric vehicle sales in China constrained lithium demand during the typical restocking season for battery manufacturers. Consequently, major industry players now project the next lithium deficit to emerge only in 2028, a sharp departure from earlier expectations. Previous investments aimed at increasing supply may propel the global carbonate equivalent supply to surge by 40% in 2024, as per UBS, intensifying the existing surplus.</p>\n<br>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Future</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Friday’s Close</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Weekly</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Monthly</th>\n<th align=\"center\">YTD</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Copper</td>\n<td align=\"center\">3.79</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-2.45</td>\n<td align=\"center\">1.87</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-3.21</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Aluminum</td>\n<td align=\"center\">2274.50</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-4.59</td>\n<td align=\"center\">5.86</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-0.91</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Zinc</td>\n<td align=\"center\">2550.99</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-4.06</td>\n<td align=\"center\">5.00</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-15.66</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Nickel</td>\n<td align=\"center\">15835</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-4.02</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-0.66</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-42.62</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tin</td>\n<td align=\"center\">24834</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-3.16</td>\n<td align=\"center\">3.20</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-1.04</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Lithium</td>\n<td align=\"center\">96500</td>\n<td align=\"center\">0</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-2.03</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-80.80</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3 id=\"Agriculture\"><a href=\"#Agriculture\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Agriculture :\"></a>Agriculture :</h3><br>\n\n<p><strong>Soybean futures drop on oversupply.</strong> Soybean futures dropped to $12.6 per bushel in the first week, marking the lowest point in almost three months and extending a 15.1% loss from 2023 due to anticipated robust production. Despite weather challenges, Brazil is poised for a record-breaking soybean harvest. Additionally, Argentina is exploring the potential to double its soybean output, while Paraguay and Uruguay also indicate substantial increases.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p><strong>Wheat futures rebound a little bit on buyer’s purchases.</strong> Wheat futures climbed above6.2 per bushel, recovering from the one-month low of 6 on January 3rd, following reports of new purchases from major consumers. The announcement that China was seeking another round of US wheat spurred buying activity from commodity funds. This potential purchase builds on a similar transaction at the end of November, which previously boosted the benchmark to $6.4.</p>\n<p><br><strong>Plam oil retreated.</strong> Malaysian palm oil futures hovered around MYR 3,700 per tonne as December’s end likely saw a decline in Malaysia’s palm oil inventories. The reduction can be attributed to diminished production caused by rainy weather and seasonal effects, as reported by a Reuters survey.</p>\n<br>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Future</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Friday’s Close</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Weekly</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Monthly</th>\n<th align=\"center\">YTD</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Soybeans</td>\n<td align=\"center\">1250.25</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-3.34</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-3.49</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-16.23</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wheat</td>\n<td align=\"center\">616.27</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-1.87</td>\n<td align=\"center\">2.72</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-17.11</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Palm Oil</td>\n<td align=\"center\">3682.00</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-1.05</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-0.99</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-9.13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td align=\"center\"></td>\n<td align=\"center\"></td>\n<td align=\"center\"></td>\n<td align=\"center\"></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<hr>\n<br>\n","categories":["Markets"],"tags":["Commodity","Weekly Recap"]},{"title":"Commodity Recap - Navigating Red Sea Tentions and Oversupply Concerns","url":"/2024/01/14/commodity_jan14/","content":"<h1 id=\"Summary\"><a href=\"#Summary\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Summary\"></a>Summary</h1><ul>\n<li><p><strong>Commodities experienced diverse path, with gold and silver slightly increase for the concerns in Middle East, while base metals mostly continued its decline for concerns of oversupply</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Soybean futures hit a three-month low amid oversupply concerns.

The USDA’s upward revision of global wheat supply forecasts for the current marketing year, driven by increased production and beginning stocks, played a significant role. Ample stocks in Ukrainian silos, coupled with higher production in Russia reaching 91 million tonnes, just shy of the record set last year, contributed to an all-time high of 51 million tonnes available for export. This substantial surplus, combined with strong harvests in Canada and Australia, resulted in heightened export forecasts, solidifying the position of these key producers in the global wheat market.</p>\n<p><br><strong>Malaysian palm oil futures held steady around MYR 3,856 per tonne, marking the seventh consecutive session of gains and reaching a five-week high.</strong> This upward trajectory is attributed to the strength in rival edible oils on the Chicago Board of Trade and an increase in crude oil prices amid deepening Middle East tensions. The weekly performance reflects a nearly 4% jump, driven by growing speculation that India, a major buyer, may escalate palm oil purchases due to concerns over the availability of sunflower and soybean oils amid tensions in the Red Sea.

Previous investments aimed at increasing supply may propel the global carbonate equivalent supply to surge by 40% in 2024, as per UBS, intensifying the existing surplus.</p>\n<br>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Future</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Friday’s Close</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Weekly</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Monthly</th>\n<th align=\"center\">YOY</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Copper</td>\n<td align=\"center\">3.78</td>\n<td align=\"center\">1.26</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-2.81</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-10.92</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Aluminum</td>\n<td align=\"center\">2178</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-1.87</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-2.81</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-16.57</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Zinc</td>\n<td align=\"center\">2473</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-1.63</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-3.89</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-27.70</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Nickel</td>\n<td align=\"center\">15918</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-1.61</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-3.63</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-45.39</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tin</td>\n<td align=\"center\">25233</td>\n<td align=\"center\">3.27</td>\n<td align=\"center\">1.66</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-13.29</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Lithium</td>\n<td align=\"center\">95500</td>\n<td align=\"center\">0</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-2.05</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-80.00</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3 id=\"Agriculture\"><a href=\"#Agriculture\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Agriculture :\"></a>Agriculture :</h3><br>\n\n<p><strong>Soybean futures drop on oversupply.</strong> Soybean futures dropped to $12.2 per bushel this week, marking the lowest point in almost three months and extending a 15.1% loss from 2023 due to anticipated robust production. Despite weather challenges, Brazil is poised for a record-breaking soybean harvest. Additionally, Argentina is exploring the potential to double its soybean output, while Paraguay and Uruguay also indicate substantial increases.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p><strong>Wheat futures saw a decline, slipping below $5.93 per bushel in January, marking the lowest point in over a month.</strong> The drop is attributed to sustained expectations of robust global supply. The USDA’s upward revision of global wheat supply forecasts for the current marketing year, driven by increased production and beginning stocks, played a significant role. Ample stocks in Ukrainian silos, coupled with higher production in Russia reaching 91 million tonnes, just shy of the record set last year, contributed to an all-time high of 51 million tonnes available for export. This substantial surplus, combined with strong harvests in Canada and Australia, resulted in heightened export forecasts, solidifying the position of these key producers in the global wheat market.</p>\n<p><br><strong>Malaysian palm oil futures held steady around MYR 3,939 per tonne, marking the seventh consecutive session of gains and reaching a six-week high.</strong> This upward trajectory is attributed to the strength in rival edible oils on the Chicago Board of Trade and an increase in crude oil prices amid deepening Middle East tensions. The weekly performance reflects a nearly 2% jump, driven by growing speculation that India, a major buyer, may escalate palm oil purchases due to concerns over the availability of sunflower and soybean oils amid tensions in the Red Sea. The confluence of global factors and regional demand fears continues to propel Malaysian palm oil futures to higher levels.</p>\n<br>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Future</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Friday’s Close</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Weekly</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Monthly</th>\n<th align=\"center\">YOY</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Soybeans</td>\n<td align=\"center\">1213</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-0.09</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-7.79</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-19.47</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wheat</td>\n<td align=\"center\">593</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-0.05</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-2.79</td>\n<td align=\"center\">-20.03</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Palm Oil</td>\n<td align=\"center\">3939</td>\n<td align=\"center\">2.15</td>\n<td align=\"center\">4.26</td>\n<td align=\"center\">1.21</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<hr>\n<br>\n","categories":["Markets"],"tags":["Commodity","Weekly Recap"]},{"title":"Latino Culture - unfinished","url":"/2023/01/30/culture_jan24/","content":"<div class=\"hbe hbe-container\" id=\"hexo-blog-encrypt\" data-wpm=\"Oh, this is an invalid password.

This global conflict, fundamentally catalyzed by the ascension of Germany’s power, ushered in a substantial reconfiguration of geopolitical dynamics across Eurasia.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>The ignition point of World War I, rooted in the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Serbia, acted as a mere trigger in a sequence of events that had been set in motion long before. The prerequisites for this trigger were meticulously laid out, with two overarching factors steering the course: <strong><u>feasibility and conflicting interests between Germany and its neighboring nations.</u></strong></p>\n<br>\n\n<p>Firstly, the conflict of interests between Germany and its neighboring countries, particularly Britain and France, played a pivotal role. The colonialist pursuits of Britain and France had yielded substantial wealth, while Germany, along with Austria and Italy, found themselves marginalized in the imperialist division of resources. By the eve of World War I, Germany had already attained an industrial prowess surpassing even that of Britain, prompting strategic recalibration through war—an endeavor to reshape the geopolitical landscape and assert influence. </p>\n<br>\n\n<p>Secondly, the feasibility of war was facilitated by the rapid development of new weapons and equipment during that era, coinciding with the industrialization of several nations,especially german’s industrilization. This convergence created a volatile environment where military capabilities were advancing alongside geopolitical ambitions.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>More precisely for the 2 reasons, the next is around the conflcting interests and the expansion of armaments. </p>\n<br>\n\n<p><strong><u>Germany ongoing conflicting interests with its neighboring nations. </u></strong> Germany, situated in Central Europe, has endured long period of division and historical strife, which is the best fertile land for nationalism. Before WW1, Britain’s expansive empire, where the sun never set, sought to protect its global interests. Germany, as a rising power yearning for its “land in the sun,” not only expanding in Europe but vying for overseas colonies, resources, and markets. The late colonial ambitions of Germany, lacking vast unclaimed territories, set the stage for conflict with existing colonial powers. The naval arms race between Britain and Germany further exacerbated tensions.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>Simultaneously, economic struggles brewed between France and Germany, rooted in the geographic mismatch of iron-rich eastern France and coal-rich western Germany. Industrialists from both countries hoped to use a victorious war to unify the entire region under their own control.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>Russia’s ambitions in the Balkans collided with Germany’s eastward expansion, while its maneuvers aimed at destabilizing the Austrian Empire exacerbated tensions. The intricate alliances and enmities weaved a complex geopolitical fabric, where the enemy of one’s enemy often became a reluctant friend. Complex alliances among Russia, Britain, France emerged, driven by shared enemies.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p><u><strong>Escalating Arms Race</strong></u>. In the years preceding the war, the acceleration of armaments reached a fever pitch. Major powers, including Germany, France, and Britain, intensified military preparations. In 1913, a major tax levied by Germany to raise special military expenditures amounted to fifty million pounds. At the same time, France extended the period of military service from two to three years, and Russia extended the period of military service by six months.  The exorbitant spending, coupled with an extension of military service and escalating naval construction plans, created an atmosphere where war seemed inevitable.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>The years preceding 1914 were marked by a series of crises, each capable of catalyzing a major war. Disputes over Morocco, Bosnia, Tripoli, and the Balkan Wars created tensions that, once overcome, birthed new conflicts. While the Balkans cannot be solely deemed the primary cause of World War I, the diplomatic deterioration in the region became a crucial factor. </p>\n<br>\n\n<p>In essence, the start of World War I was not an isolated incident but the culmination of a complex interplay of geopolitical forces, industrial advancements, and conflicting imperial ambitions once they achived their unification. </p>\n<br>\n\n<p>While my advocacy for peace is unwavering, I recognize that the world operates under the sway of strength rather than humanitarian ideals—often validated through the harrowing language of blood and tears. Germany’s engagement in two wars finds its roots in its formidable strength, a force that allowed it to compete on the global stage. In the pursuit of territorial ambitions, war, albeit destructive, presented itself as a straightforward means, as the acquisition of land was not up for negotiation.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>Indeed, Germany has the capability to compete with other nations, even as a late comer. Germany’s rapid ascent as a late-developing country, surpassing the United Kingdom in economic scale and technological prowess, stems from the advantages inherent in being a latecomer. Yet, the drawbacks are unmistakable, particularly the tendency to be blinded by self-achievement, fostering a misguided belief in the inherent superiority of the nation. Germany, unlike other late-developing nations in the imitation stage for technology transfer and market expansion, led the world in science and invention. Moreover, its contributions to philosophy, academics, literature, and the arts, though constituting soft power, were globally renowned. The pride Germany felt during this era, though potentially harmful, was not entirely unfounded. Since then, many late-developing countries have failed to reach such heights, or even fall behind. As for its failure in World War, Germany’s geographical position posed both advantages and disadvantages. While its central location in Europe surrounded by major nations presented wartime challenges, it positioned Germany as a formidable trading power during peacetime, with access to both land and sea routes. The sea, however, imposed severe restrictions on Germany’s navy, highlighting the delicate balance between geographical advantages and wartime limitations.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>This international relations paradigm, deeply rooted in European history, posits that the rise and fall of nations are intimately linked to war. Any ascending power is perceived as a challenge, determined not by intentions but by strength—an inherent desire for development or dominating rights shared by all nations. </p>\n<h2 id=\"Post-War\"><a href=\"#Post-War\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Post War\"></a>Post War</h2><br>\n\n<p><strong><u>After WW2, Post-Cold War as U.S. and Russia diverged strategically, with Russia initially leaning towards NATO amid disintegration but later pivoting to the East due to China’s rise, reshaping global power dynamics.</u></strong></p>\n<br>\n\n<h3 id=\"Post-Cold-War\"><a href=\"#Post-Cold-War\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Post-Cold War\"></a>Post-Cold War</h3><br>\n\n<p>Post cold war set the two major power seperately in East and West, so inevitably Sino-Soviet should deteriorate. </p>\n<br>\n\n<p>Between 1950 and 1963, often dubbed the “honeymoon period” of Sino-Soviet relations, both nations inked a series of agreements spanning trade, higher education, nuclear technology, and industry. The Soviet Union’s extensive support for China during this era included military involvement in the Korean War, where Chinese troops directly confronted the United Nations forces led by the United States. This shared military endeavor solidified China’s international alignment towards the Soviet Union, albeit temporarily. However, the euphoria dissipated in 1963, when official negotiations in Moscow between the Soviet and Chinese Communist Parties acknowledged irreconcilable differences. The ensuing tension escalated into border conflicts and military clashes in 1969.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>Inevitably, after the rise of “revised Sovietism”,  The Soviet Union deployed millions of troops in strategic locations, attempting to create a Sino-Soviet buffer zone. Ambitious endeavors in regions such as Outer Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Afghanistan underscored the geopolitical complexity. Meanwhile, Vietnam, under Le Duan’s leadership, adopted a pro-Soviet, anti-Chinese stance. In response, China pursued diplomatic outreach to nations like Nepal and North Korea while fostering improved relations with Japan and the United States, particularly in the context of heightened tensions between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The United States wanted to contain the power of the Soviet Union.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>The U.S. extended Marshall Plans in the Western world, emphasizing long-term interests and the establishment of a new world order. Concurrently, the Soviet Union wielded force to redraw territorial lines. <strong><u>Current complex interplay between China and US echoed historical patterns</u></strong>, creating a global landscape not entirely divorced from its past, yet distinct in its own right. As the geopolitical chessboard continues to evolve, echoes of the past resonate in the present, shaping the intricate dance of nations on the world stage.</p>\n<br>\n\n<h3 id=\"Soviet-Union’s-Disintegration\"><a href=\"#Soviet-Union’s-Disintegration\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Soviet Union’s Disintegration\"></a>Soviet Union’s Disintegration</h3><br>\n\n<p>Following the Soviet Union’s disintegration in 1991, Russia, under Yeltsin, faced economic challenges, political corruption, and regional issues like Chechen independence. Seeking stability, <strong><u>Yeltsin pursued a pro-Western strategy, expressing interest in joining NATO in 1991</u></strong>. However, Western “shock therapy” policies and perceived containment efforts strained relations. In 1999, NATO’s bombing campaign in Yugoslavia deepened tensions, leading to Russia’s failed attempt to join NATO.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>Putin, succeeding Yeltsin, initially aimed to improve relations. In 2001, Russia reapplied to NATO, but under George W. Bush, the U.S. declared Russia a strategic competitor. NATO’s eastward expansion intensified, fueling Russo-NATO tensions. Despite Putin’s proposal in 2008 to join NATO, the U.S. remained skeptical, fearing impure motives. The Russo-Georgian War in 2008 further strained relations, dashing hopes of Russian NATO membership. NATO’s continual expansion, coupled with U.S. hesitations, exacerbated tensions. </p>\n<br>\n\n<h3 id=\"Rise-of-China\"><a href=\"#Rise-of-China\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Rise of China\"></a>Rise of China</h3><br>\n\n<p>NATO’s continuous expansion, coupled with Western hesitation and the rise of China, exacerbated tensions, ultimately contributing to recent conflicts, including the war between Russia and Ukraine. Therefore, the war in Ukraine is not a whim, but a dynamic change in the entire East and West.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>The onset of the Russo-Ukrainian war has spurred Finland and Sweden’s fervent desire to join NATO, indicating a shared perception of deteriorating international relations. Both nations, traditionally neutral, opt for NATO membership as a strategic move driven by the belief that a collective security framework is essential in the face of geopolitical uncertainties. This shift underscores a pragmatic calculation of common interests, as Finland and Sweden anticipate bilateral benefits within NATO rather than maintaining their traditional status as neutral countries. The quest for NATO membership reflects a strategic repositioning to navigate the changing dynamics of international relations amidst the Russo-Ukrainian conflict.</p>\n<br>\n\n<h3 id=\"Dependency-Theory\"><a href=\"#Dependency-Theory\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Dependency Theory\"></a>Dependency Theory</h3><br>\n\n<p>Examining historical patterns, the recurring challenge in Eurasia lies in <strong><u>constant conflicts between core and peripheral countries.</u></strong> Peripheral nations, like Turkey and Hungary, find themselves in a delicate position, far from the centers of power. The optimal strategy for these countries involves avoiding allegiance to a single side forcefully. Instead, it is advantageous to weaken both sides unless crucial to a specific party. </p>\n<br>\n\n<p>Loyalty levels in the relationships between core and peripheral countries fluctuate. Marginalized nations, less favored, inevitably experience exploitation, conflicts, and shifts in their stance. National interests, often unspoken at the individual level, create a web of ever-changing relationships between countries.<strong><u> In this arena, there are no eternal friends, only eternal interests. </u></strong> The dynamics, be it war or trade frictions, are devoid of morality, driven solely by the responsibility to millions of people. Peace, in this context, rests on a nation’s strength, not humanitarian ideals.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>In the quest for European hegemony, some countries find themselves stuck in the middle, distant from rising core nations, with their interests oscillating in uncertainty. Finland, wedged between Sweden and Tsarist Russia, or Poland and Ukraine, caught between Russia and Germany, exemplify this precarious positioning. Turkey, straddling Asia, Africa, and Europe, faces an even more complex geopolitical challenge. </p>\n<br>\n\n<p><strong><u>Peripheral countries must strategically position themselves.</u></strong> Some, like Poland, lean towards pro-European and American stances, while others, like Finland and Sweden, traditionally preferred military neutrality. The Russo-Ukrainian war prompted Sweden to reconsider its alliance policy. </p>\n<p><br>Alternatively, countries like Turkey may choose a disruptive path to maximize their interests, echoing the historical sentiment captured in the TV series “Yes, Prime Minister” regarding British foreign policy’s goal of dividing Europe. </p>\n<br>\n\n<p>TV series lines as followed: Minister, Britain has had the same foreign policy objectives for at least the last 500 year to create a disunited Europe. In that cause, we have fought with the Dutch against the Spanish, with the Germans against the French, with the French and Italians against the Germans, and with the French against the Germans and Italians. Divide and rule , you see. We had to break the whole thing up, but that wouldn’t work, so we had to get inside. The foreign office is pro-Europe, because its really anti-Europe. The civil service was united in its desire to make sure that common market didn’t work, that’s why we were into it. If not, why are we pressing for an increase in the membership? Well, for the same reason, it is just like the United Nations in fact. The more members it has, the more arquments it can stir up, the more futile and impotent it becomes. What appalling cynicism, which is called diplomacy. </p>\n<br>\n\n<p>Characterizing pro-European actions as serving anti-European objectives may be biased. The European Union’s common market indeed brings substantial benefits to its member states during favorable conditions. It facilitates market flow and fosters market expansion, enhancing economic prosperity. However, the fairness of the global landscape is multifaceted, akin to Germany’s less-than-ideal geographical locationd during wartime, better than ideal during peacetime. To fully embrace the advantages of EU membership, member states must be prepared to make certain compromises when circumstances demand it.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>Neutral countries, exemplified by Switzerland, employ an “armed neutrality strategy. Switzerland, nestled between France and Germany, has perfected the art of neutrality, acting as a crucial buffer during times of conflict. Its strategic positioning allowed it to facilitate military preparations for both Germany and France, offering refuge to French nobles and safeguarding their assets. Switzerland, aware of its military limitations, builds itself into a hedgehog. Its armed populace, universal military service, and strategic Alpine location create a formidable defense. This neutral stance allows Switzerland to act as a buffer, deterring potential invaders by making conquest more costly than the gains. </p>\n<br>\n\n<p><strong><u>So, the reason for why sweden wanna join NATO and the opposition to Sweden’s NATO membership with Hungary and Turkey may rely on the both side intention of seeking greater interests.</u></strong> Excuses could be motivations may stem from response of Swedish comments for Hungary’s democracy or Turkey’s accusations against Sweden sheltering Kurdish militants. The peripheral countries’ goal remains securing resources amidst core countries’ competition. Diplomatic relations and alliances may shift, demonstrating the pragmatic pursuit of national interests in a world dominated by the ebb and flow of geopolitical realities. </p>\n<br>\n\n<h3 id=\"Takeaways\"><a href=\"#Takeaways\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Takeaways\"></a>Takeaways</h3><br>\n\n<p><strong><u>Be more cautious for the potential escalating geopolitical issues.</u></strong> Examining the map, it’s evident that the small marginal countries at the crossroads of the Eurasian continent are aligning with distinct sides, representing broader Eastern and Western forces led by the United States and China. The looming possibility of a conflict between these major powers, whether initiated by the dominant United States or challenged by the latecomer China, increases as compromise becomes elusive. Both sides may need a war to set the new order. Current events, such as the Hamas-Israel conflict, tensions in the Red Sea, and disputes in the Taiwan Strait, suggest a path toward realization. </p>\n<br>\n\n<p><strong><u>Peace and Love. </u></strong> While nobody wishes for war, history has shown that it’s an inevitable part of the human journey. In times of turmoil, peripheral countries prioritize their interests over emotions, ready to sever ties or forge close collaborations. The state machine, with its collective leadership, remains unwavering, serving the interests of millions. In this context, personal sentiments and moral unity take a back seat to the responsibility of individuals who contribute to the government, even as positions change. The country, acting as a rational entity, demands allegiance. For core countries, the pursuit of enduring love and peace remains paramount. Those in positions of influence bear the responsibility to extend kindness, having achieved their aspirations. A plea is made to contribute to global tranquility, recognizing the impact of their elevated positions on the world stage. In a world brimming with complexities, fostering peace becomes a shared imperative.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Books-to-Read\"><a href=\"#Books-to-Read\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Books to Read\"></a>Books to Read</h3><p>Continental power and maritime checks and balances</p>\n<p>Why is Buddhism true?</p>\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"-1\"><a href=\"#-1\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"\"></a></h3>","categories":["Markets"],"tags":["Events","Econ"]},{"title":"Markets Recap - Record Highs, Central Bank Signals","url":"/2023/12/16/macro_dec16/","content":"<h1 id=\"Summary\"><a href=\"#Summary\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Summary\"></a>Summary</h1><ul>\n<li><p><strong>U.S. Stock Market: The U.S. market extended its winning streak with record highs in major indices, a surge in small caps, and elevated trading volumes.

Headline inflation, standing at 4.62% in December, surpassed market expectations of 4.54%. While the central bank is anticipated to implement its fifth consecutive 50bps cut this month, the persistent risk of upside price growth may prompt policymakers to temper their dovish signals, leading to a potentially more cautious approach to Brazilian disinflation. This shift in expectations toward a more hawkish stance was evident in the currency market, where the real appreciated by 0.42% against the US dollar this week. Additionally, for the long term, Brazil’s currency exhibited resilience, attributed to the country’s record trade surplus of $98.8 billion in 2023, marking a substantial 60.6% increase from the previous year. This surplus, driven by expanded exports in agriculture and extractive industries, has not only bolstered foreign currency inflows but also contributed to the strength of the real. As Brazil navigates these economic challenges, policymakers face a delicate balance in responding to both contractionary forces and inflationary pressures.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>The Ibovespa, however, experienced a 0.7% loss, initially influenced by lower oil prices earlier in the week. The later disruption of commercial routes in the Red Sea due to U.S. and UK airstrikes on Houthi targets in Yemen led to a surge in oil prices by week-end, benefitting Petrobras and ultimately contributing to a 0.3% increase in the Ibovespa.</p>\n<br>\n\n<h3 id=\"Mexico\"><a href=\"#Mexico\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Mexico\"></a>Mexico</h3><p><strong>In Mexico, mirroring the trend in Brazil, the Mexican peso strengthened, surpassing the 16.86 per USD level.</strong> December’s inflation data revealed a month-over-month headline inflation of 0.7%, with a year-over-year rate of 4.7%, slightly exceeding expectations. The central bank is anticipated to maintain a vigilant stance against broader inflation, signaling a reluctance for immediate interest rate cuts until sustained signs of longer-lasting disinflation emerge. Concurrently, the World Bank adjusted Mexico’s growth projection for 2024, elevating it from 1.9% to a more optimistic 2.6%. This adjustment underscores the resilience of the Mexican economy in the face of aggressive rate hikes in the previous year, providing a positive outlook for the nation’s economic trajectory.<br></p>\n<p>Recent economic indicators further underscored the resilience of the Mexican economy, with business confidence reaching a ten-year high. Additionally, unemployment remained at levels unseen in over twenty years. These factors collectively contribute to a favorable outlook for Mexico’s economic stability and growth.</p>\n<br>\n\n<h3 id=\"Argentina\"><a href=\"#Argentina\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Argentina\"></a>Argentina</h3><p>The USD to ARS exchange rate increased by 0.07% on Friday for the week.

This strengthening trend is attributed to robust economic data and sustained intervention by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). India’s GDP growth stood at an impressive 7.3% in the 2023-24 fiscal year, surpassing market expectations and highlighting the resilience of the Indian economy amidst the RBI’s tightening cycle in the preceding year. The RBI’s consistent intervention in the foreign exchange markets, preventing the rupee from breaching its record low of 83.4, has instilled confidence in investors.

Additionally, the Russian finance ministry announced a shift from forex purchases to sales in the coming weeks, aiming to offset lower revenues from oil and gas in the past month.
