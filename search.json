However, concerns about a looming recession persisted, influencing central bank policies.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Sectoral Challenges and Geopolitical Tensions: While certain sectors thrived, such as U.S. tech giants, others faced headwinds, like China’s gaming industry.

Investor confidence grew as concerns about an impending recession diminished. Notably, the S&amp;P500 surged by 84 basis points, with communication services stocks, including Alphabet and Meta Platforms, playing a pivotal role in supporting this advancement.<br></p>\n<p><strong>The U.S. bonds market witnessed further gains</strong>, accompanied by a decline in short-term bond yields. The Federal Reserve’s comments during the week, hinting at potential interest rate cuts in the coming year, influenced market dynamics. However, the Fed expressed worries about the economy slowing down too rapidly, particularly in light of a sharp increase in the unemployment rate. Data from the week supported these concerns, with core PCE rising only 0.1% in November, marking the first decline in headline PCE since 2021. Other notable data included surprising figures in home sales, housing starts, and a significant 8% increase in orders for non-defense capital goods – the largest since 2004.<br><br></p>\n<h3 id=\"EU-Market\"><a href=\"#EU-Market\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"EU Market :\"></a>EU Market :<br><br></h3><p><strong>Parallel trends like US.</strong> European markets mirrored the positive sentiment seen in the U.S., with the European Stoxx 600 rising by 20 basis points to maintain a one-year high. The UK’s index saw a 1% gain as inflation cooled down. However, concerns loomed over the economy’s proximity to recession, as reflected in the lowered GDP forecast. German companies showed increased pessimism due to continued shrinkage in their order books.<br><br></p>\n<h3 id=\"Asian-Market\"><a href=\"#Asian-Market\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Asian Market :\"></a>Asian Market :<br><br></h3><p><strong>Japan maintains stability.</strong> Japan’s markets experienced modest gains or remained largely unchanged, thanks to support from a more dovish Bank of Japan (BOJ). The BOJ provided forward guidance during the December meeting but refrained from commenting on potential monetary policy tweaks, in contrast to the previous week. The initial weakening of the yen and a decline in the bond market to 0.62% from 0.7% last week were notable.</p>\n<p><strong>China faces market headwinds.</strong> China’s stock market witnessed a decline, primarily attributed to new restrictions on the gaming sector. The Shanghai Composite Index dropped by almost 1%, erasing nearly $80 billion in market value. Investors expressed concerns about future earnings and a potential regulatory crackdown, reminiscent of actions taken against tech companies two years ago. Anticipation of further easing by the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) in 2024 added to the market uncertainty, driven by deflationary pressures on the economy.<br><br></p>\n<h3 id=\"Other-Markets\"><a href=\"#Other-Markets\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Other Markets :\"></a>Other Markets :<br><br></h3><p><strong>Oil prices surge amidst red sea concerns.</strong> Global oil prices surged as investor concerns heightened over attacks on shipping in the Red Sea. The geopolitical tensions in the region drove increased attention to the potential disruptions in oil supply chains.<br></p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"\"><a href=\"#\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"\"></a></h3>","categories":["Markets"],"tags":["Macro","Weekly Recap"]},{"title":"Markets Recap - Record Highs, Central Bank Signals","url":"/2023/12/16/recap_dec16/","content":"<h1 id=\"Summary\"><a href=\"#Summary\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Summary\"></a>Summary</h1><ul>\n<li><p><strong>U.S. Stock Market: The U.S. market extended its winning streak with record highs in major indices, a surge in small caps, and elevated trading volumes.

Small caps outperformed, surging by 5%. Trading volumes were notably elevated towards the end of the week, reaching a new high for the year. The VIX, often referred to as the fear gauge, dropped to its lowest level post-pandemic.<br></p>\n<p>**Key economic indicators supported a positive market sentiment. The Tuesday report on consumer price inflation aligned with expectations, showing a year-over-year rate of 4%. The Federal Reserve (FED) kept interest rates unchanged as anticipated and gave no indication of pushing back against market expectations for aggressive cuts next year. Retail sales for November unexpectedly rose by 0.3%, though this could be attributed to the holiday season. However, manufacturing sector data hinted at potential disappointments.<br></p>\n<p>The 10-year Treasury bond yield fell to 4%, a level not seen since July. This drop was influenced by signals from the FED, indicating a cooling inflation and more dovish stance. In this risk-on environment, corporate bonds outperformed.<br><br></p>\n<h3 id=\"EU-Market\"><a href=\"#EU-Market\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"EU Market :\"></a>EU Market :<br><br></h3><p>In Europe, the Stoxx Europe 600 ended 1% higher. However, major indices showed mixed performance, with France outperforming the UK and Germany. The European Central Bank (ECB) left interest rates relatively unchanged but lowered its inflation and growth forecasts for 2023, projecting 2% in 2026. The ECB also announced plans to phase out the reinvestment of maturing securities in its emergency pandemic program, signaling a reduction in bond purchases and reinvestments.<br></p>\n<p>Business activity in the Eurozone continued to contract, as indicated by the PMI for manufacturing and service sectors remaining below 50 for the seventh consecutive month. In the UK, GDP remained flat for the three months ending October.<br><br></p>\n<h3 id=\"Asian-Market\"><a href=\"#Asian-Market\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Asian Market :\"></a>Asian Market :<br><br></h3><p>Japan’s stock market saw a 2% surge in the Nikkei, supported by signals of interest rate cuts from the FED. However, the strengthening yen could pose challenges for exporters due to expectations of narrowing U.S.-Japan interest rate differentials. Bond yields fell to 0.7% due to investor sentiment on the Bank of Japan’s policy pivot. PMI data showed a mild expansion in Japan’s private sector business activity, but a political scandal involving the ruling party impacted its popularity.<br></p>\n<p>The Chinese stock market experienced a decline due to deflationary pressures, with CPI continuing to decline by 0.5% compared to the previous year. Concerns about deflation triggering an economic downturn led to market worries. Other economic indicators presented mixed results, with industrial output growing, retail sales surging by 10%, and fixed asset investment rising, though it missed expectations. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) injected 1 billion into the banking system, but lending rates remained unchanged, prompting speculation that the PBOC may intensify policy support to bolster the economy.<br><br></p>\n<h3 id=\"Other-Markets\"><a href=\"#Other-Markets\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Other Markets :\"></a>Other Markets :<br><br></h3><p>In other markets, Treasury yields rose, pushing the 10-year yield below 4%. The U.S. dollar fell against all its developed-market peers, driven partly by gains in the euro and pound following signals from the European Central Bank that they are not in a hurry to join the U.S. in interest rate cuts.<br></p>\n<p>Oil held steady in a lukewarm session following concerns that supplies are outpacing demand, leading to the longest weekly losing streak in five years.<br></p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"\"><a href=\"#\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"\"></a></h3>","categories":["Markets"],"tags":["Macro","Weekly Recap"]},{"title":"A Playlist for Imagine Dragons","url":"/2023/12/31/playlist_dec31/","content":"<h1 id=\"\"><a href=\"#\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"\"></a></h1><h1 id=\"“Music-has-the-power-to-move-the-soul\"><a href=\"#“Music-has-the-power-to-move-the-soul\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"“Music has the power to move the soul\"></a>“Music has the power to move the soul</h1><h1 id=\"Imagine-Dragons’-anthems-ignite-the-fire-within-”\"><a href=\"#Imagine-Dragons’-anthems-ignite-the-fire-within-”\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Imagine Dragons’ anthems ignite the fire within.”\"></a>Imagine Dragons’ anthems ignite the fire within.”</h1><br>\n\n<span id=\"more\"></span>\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n<h3 id=\"-1\"><a href=\"#-1\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"\"></a><br><br></h3><h2 id=\"Playlist\"><a href=\"#Playlist\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Playlist\"></a>Playlist</h2><p>“Symphony”</p>\n<p>“Natural”</p>\n<p>“Bones”  </p>\n<p>“Believer” </p>\n<p>“Thunder” </p>\n<p>“On Top of the World” </p>\n<p>“Enemy” </p>\n<p>“Sharks” </p>\n<p>“Higher Ground” </p>\n<p>“Only” </p>\n<p>“Love” </p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"-2\"><a href=\"#-2\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"\"></a></h3>","categories":["Beyond"],"tags":["Playlist"]}]
