Major indices across Europe posted gains, with France's CAC 40, Italy's FTSE MIB, and Germany's DAX all advancing. However, the UK's FTSE 100 remained relatively flat, reflecting weakness in mining and energy sectors.\n\n<br>\n\n**European government bond yields saw downward pressure** as investors revised expectations for interest rate cuts following stronger-than-expected purchasing managers' surveys.

Strong domestic corporate profits, robust export prospects amid a weaker yen, and the Bank of Japan's commitment to maintaining accommodative monetary policy also contributed to the market rally.\n\n<br>\n\n**The Chinese market experienced a robust rally fueled by hopes of economic recovery following strong holiday spending during the Lunar New Year.** The Shanghai Composite Index and the blue chip CSI 300 surged, while the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong also recorded significant gains. Data indicated a substantial increase in tourism revenue during the holiday period, surpassing pre-pandemic levels.

Despite the softer stance from EU monetary policy, the euro found support from positive sentiment in the stock market. Meanwhile, the Japanese yen weakened, approaching its lowest levels in over three months as investors continued to utilize yen for carry trades.\n\n<br>\n\n**WTI crude futures experienced a decline to $76.49 per barrel, reflecting a weekly loss of over 3%.** The drop followed comments from Fed Governor Christopher Waller suggesting potential delays in interest rate cuts, signaling concerns about economic growth and dampened oil demand. Additionally, the International Energy Agency's report highlighted a slowdown in global oil demand due to the increasing shift towards renewable energy sources.\n\n<br>\n\n**Gold prices remained above $2,020 an ounce, poised to end the week higher.** The precious metal was supported by a weaker dollar and increased safe-haven demand amid uncertainty surrounding the timing and extent of potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in response to mixed US economic data.\n\n<br>\n\n| Other markets | Friday's close | Weekly | Monthly | YOY    |\n| ------------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:------:|\n| DOLLAR        | 103.96         | -0.32  | 0.71    | -1.18  |\n| EUR/USD       | 1.08           | 0.40   | -0.61   | 2.57   |\n| GBP/USD       | 1.27           | 0.56   | -0.43   | 6.07   |\n| USD/JPY       | 150.49         | 0.19   | 2.03    | 10.28  |\n| USD/CNY       | 7.20           | -0.10  | 0.61    | 3.21   |\n| GOLD          | 2035           | 1.10   | 1.13    | 12.40  |\n| CRUDE OIL     | 76.49          | -2.51  | 2.01    | -0.03  |\n| BTC-USD       | 51485          | -0.62  | 29.04   | 124.43 |\n| ETH-USD       | 2986           | 7.20   | 34.66   | 89.76  |\n\n<br><br>\n\n---\n","tags":["Weekly Recap","Macro"],"categories":["Markets"]},{"title":"Regional Markets - Brazilian Real and Mexican Peso Face Weakening Trends, Indian Rupee and Turkish Lira Hold Steady amidst Economic Uncertainties","url":"/2024/02/23/mmarket_feb24/","content":"\n# Summary\n\n- **Latin American markets saw the Brazilian real weaken amid a hawkish Federal Reserve stance and missed trade surplus expectations, while the Mexican peso depreciated on signs of an impending rate cut and lower-than-expected inflation data.**\n\n- **The Indian rupee held firm amid global uncertainties, benefiting from strong domestic economic data and strong confidence from investor.** \n\n- **The Russian ruble steadied near a two-month low amid anticipation of stricter EU sanctions and disruptions in fuel production, while Turkey's lira remained unchanged, balancing between the hawkish central bank stance and record highs in the stock market.** \n\n<br>\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n### Latin America : <br><br>\n\n### Brazil\n\n**Brazil's currency weakened as the Federal Reserve's hawkish stance impacted, while mixed corporate results influenced a modest stock market gain.** The Brazilian real weakened to around 4.99 per USD by Friday, driven by a more hawkish stance from the Federal Reserve. Latest inflation data exceeded the BCB’s upper tolerance band at 4.51%, indicating upside risks. Additionally, Brazil’s trade surplus in January missed market expectations, exacerbating an unexpected decline in foreign direct investment from December and limiting foreign currency inflows. In the stock market, the Ibovespa secured a modest gain of 0.5% for the week, supported by mixed corporate results. Despite a 35% decline in fourth-quarter profits, Vale announced dividends exceeding R$11 billion, with its shares ending slightly higher by 0.3%, helping offset the impact of disappointing earnings reports on the index. However, state-owned oil giant Petrobras led the energy sector downward with a 0.5% loss, influenced by lower oil prices.\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n### Mexico\n\n**Mexico, the peso depreciated amid anticipation of a central bank rate cut.** The Mexican peso weakened to around 17.11 per USD by Friday, reaching a one-week low amid growing expectations of an imminent rate cut by the Mexican central bank. On Thursday, Mexico’s government reported consumer price inflation for the first half of February, surprising to the downside. Headline inflation declined to a year-over-year rate of 4.5%, down from 4.9% in the previous reading, while core inflation fell to 4.6%, compared to 4.8% previously. The main stock market index in Mexico (IPC Mexico) has decreased by 726 points or 1.27% since the beginning of 2024.\n\n<br>\n\n### Argentina\n\nThe USD to ARS exchange rate increased by 0.47% for the week as more harkish stance from US fed reserve goveror.

India's composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) exceeded 60 for the second consecutive month in February, reinforcing the robust 7.3% growth achieved in FY2023. This stellar performance outpaced other major economies, fostering a bullish environment and attracting foreign exchange inflows. Foreign investment into India also benefited from investors reallocating funds away from China, propelling the Sensex towards record highs and driving down the yield on the 10-year Government Securities (G-Sec) to multi-month lows. Robust economic growth provided further support to the rupee, offering the RBI flexibility to maintain its hawkish stance.\n\n<br>\n\n| Markets | Friday's Close | Weekly | Monthly | YOY   |\n| ------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:-----:|\n| USD/INR | 82.85          | -0.19  | -0.33   | -0.05 |\n| SENSEX  | 73143          | 0.99   | 2.93    | 23.00 |\n\n<br>\n\n### EU :<br><br>\n\n### Russia\n\n**The ruble steadied near 93 per USD amid EU sanctions concerns.** The Russian ruble steadied near 93 per USD, hovering close to a two-month low reached on February 19th. This was primarily influenced by news of the 13th package of EU sanctions, anticipated for approval by the end of the week. Stricter sanctions could potentially halt loading activities and exacerbate the fuel production and export constraints due to Ukrainian attacks on Russian refineries, intensifying the existing capacity crisis. Additionally, the Central Bank of Russia revised its medium-term forecast for the current account from $75 billion to $42 billion in 2024, indicating a significant decline in foreign currency inflows. The ruble-based MOEX Russia index closed 3.2% lower on Friday as investors weighed the risks associated with the impending sanctions package from the EU and the US ahead of the national holiday.\n\n<br>\n\n### Turkey\n\n**Turkey's lira held steady amidst central bank decisions.** Turkey's lira remained unchanged throughout the week amidst a balancing act between the hawkish stance of Türkiye’s central bank and the US Federal Reserve. In its scheduled monetary policy meeting on Thursday, Türkiye’s central bank maintained its key interest rate, the one-week repo auction rate, at 45.0%, as widely expected. The post-meeting statement adopted a hawkish tone, with policymakers indicating a willingness to tighten monetary policy further in response to \"a significant and persistent deterioration\" in the inflation outlook. Turkey's main stock market index, BIST 100, continued to reach new record highs, approaching the 9400 level in February. Year-to-date gains extended to about 25%, as traders evaluated Turkey's monetary and economic prospects.\n\n<br>\n\n| Markets  | Friday's Close | Weekly | Monthly | YOY   |\n| -------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:-----:|\n| USD/RUB  | 93.62          | 1.77   | 5.49    | 23.18 |\n| USD/TRY  | 30.82          | 0.03   | 1.98    | 63.38 |\n| MOEX     | 3142           | -3.78  | -1.05   | 42.31 |\n| BIST 100 | 9374           | 1.34   | 15.86   | 85.31 |\n| TURKEY-B | 25.13          | 1.31   | 0.41    | 14.90 |\n\n<br><br>\n\n### Other Markets :\n\n| Markets | Friday's Close | Weekly | Monthly | YOY    |\n| ------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:------:|\n| USD/CHF | 0.88           | 0.04   | 2.10    | -6.38  |\n| USD/KRW | 1329           | -0.10  | -0.16   | 1.18   |\n| USD/NGN | 1488           | -0.29  | 65.51   | 223.61 |\n| USD/ZAR | 19.32          | 2.37   | 2.35    | 4.98   |\n| TAIEX   | 18889          | 1.52   | 5.67    | 21.84  |\n| NSE     | 102088         | -3.44  | 0.51    | 85.79  |\n\n---\n","tags":["Weekly Recap","Regional Markets"],"categories":["Markets"]},{"title":"Markets Recap - U.S. Hits Records, Europe Rises on Earnings, Mixed Trends in Asia","url":"/2024/01/28/macro_jan28/","content":"\n# Summary\n\n- **U.S. stocks surged to record highs for positive earning, while the bond market showed limited movement amid mixed economic data and minimal commentary from Federal Reserve officials.

One sentence to summerize is Tuekey want to maxmise its interests in the need for Sweden joinning NATO for more safety.</u>** \n\n#### <br>\n\n## Dynamic Relationship from WW1\n\n<br>\n\n### Reason for WW1\n\n<br>\n\nWhen delving into NATO-related issues, a pivotal historical juncture that demands attention is the era of World War I, a transformative period that left an indelible mark on the contours of the Eurasian continent. This global conflict, fundamentally catalyzed by the ascension of Germany's power, ushered in a substantial reconfiguration of geopolitical dynamics across Eurasia.\n\n<br>\n\nThe ignition point of World War I, rooted in the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Serbia, acted as a mere trigger in a sequence of events that had been set in motion long before. The prerequisites for this trigger were meticulously laid out, with two overarching factors steering the course: **<u>feasibility and conflicting interests between Germany and its neighboring nations.</u>**\n\n<br>\n\nFirstly, the conflict of interests between Germany and its neighboring countries, particularly Britain and France, played a pivotal role. The colonialist pursuits of Britain and France had yielded substantial wealth, while Germany, along with Austria and Italy, found themselves marginalized in the imperialist division of resources. By the eve of World War I, Germany had already attained an industrial prowess surpassing even that of Britain, prompting strategic recalibration through war—an endeavor to reshape the geopolitical landscape and assert influence. \n\n<br>\n\nSecondly, the feasibility of war was facilitated by the rapid development of new weapons and equipment during that era, coinciding with the industrialization of several nations,especially german's industrilization. This convergence created a volatile environment where military capabilities were advancing alongside geopolitical ambitions.\n\n<br>\n\nMore precisely for the 2 reasons, the next is around the conflcting interests and the expansion of armaments. \n\n<br>\n\n**<u>Germany ongoing conflicting interests with its neighboring nations. </u>** Germany, situated in Central Europe, has endured long period of division and historical strife, which is the best fertile land for nationalism. Before WW1, Britain's expansive empire, where the sun never set, sought to protect its global interests. Germany, as a rising power yearning for its \"land in the sun,\" not only expanding in Europe but vying for overseas colonies, resources, and markets. The late colonial ambitions of Germany, lacking vast unclaimed territories, set the stage for conflict with existing colonial powers. The naval arms race between Britain and Germany further exacerbated tensions.\n\n<br>\n\nSimultaneously, economic struggles brewed between France and Germany, rooted in the geographic mismatch of iron-rich eastern France and coal-rich western Germany. Industrialists from both countries hoped to use a victorious war to unify the entire region under their own control.\n\n<br>\n\nRussia's ambitions in the Balkans collided with Germany's eastward expansion, while its maneuvers aimed at destabilizing the Austrian Empire exacerbated tensions. The intricate alliances and enmities weaved a complex geopolitical fabric, where the enemy of one's enemy often became a reluctant friend. Complex alliances among Russia, Britain, France emerged, driven by shared enemies.\n\n<br>\n\n<u>**Escalating Arms Race**</u>. In the years preceding the war, the acceleration of armaments reached a fever pitch. Major powers, including Germany, France, and Britain, intensified military preparations. In 1913, a major tax levied by Germany to raise special military expenditures amounted to fifty million pounds. At the same time, France extended the period of military service from two to three years, and Russia extended the period of military service by six months.  The exorbitant spending, coupled with an extension of military service and escalating naval construction plans, created an atmosphere where war seemed inevitable.\n\n<br>\n\nThe years preceding 1914 were marked by a series of crises, each capable of catalyzing a major war. Disputes over Morocco, Bosnia, Tripoli, and the Balkan Wars created tensions that, once overcome, birthed new conflicts. While the Balkans cannot be solely deemed the primary cause of World War I, the diplomatic deterioration in the region became a crucial factor. \n\n<br>\n\nIn essence, the start of World War I was not an isolated incident but the culmination of a complex interplay of geopolitical forces, industrial advancements, and conflicting imperial ambitions once they achived their unification. \n\n<br>\n\nWhile my advocacy for peace is unwavering, I recognize that the world operates under the sway of strength rather than humanitarian ideals—often validated through the harrowing language of blood and tears. Germany's engagement in two wars finds its roots in its formidable strength, a force that allowed it to compete on the global stage. In the pursuit of territorial ambitions, war, albeit destructive, presented itself as a straightforward means, as the acquisition of land was not up for negotiation.\n\n<br>\n\nIndeed, Germany has the capability to compete with other nations, even as a late comer. Germany's rapid ascent as a late-developing country, surpassing the United Kingdom in economic scale and technological prowess, stems from the advantages inherent in being a latecomer. Yet, the drawbacks are unmistakable, particularly the tendency to be blinded by self-achievement, fostering a misguided belief in the inherent superiority of the nation. Germany, unlike other late-developing nations in the imitation stage for technology transfer and market expansion, led the world in science and invention. Moreover, its contributions to philosophy, academics, literature, and the arts, though constituting soft power, were globally renowned. The pride Germany felt during this era, though potentially harmful, was not entirely unfounded. Since then, many late-developing countries have failed to reach such heights, or even fall behind. As for its failure in World War, Germany's geographical position posed both advantages and disadvantages. While its central location in Europe surrounded by major nations presented wartime challenges, it positioned Germany as a formidable trading power during peacetime, with access to both land and sea routes. The sea, however, imposed severe restrictions on Germany's navy, highlighting the delicate balance between geographical advantages and wartime limitations.\n\n<br>\n\nThis international relations paradigm, deeply rooted in European history, posits that the rise and fall of nations are intimately linked to war. Any ascending power is perceived as a challenge, determined not by intentions but by strength—an inherent desire for development or dominating rights shared by all nations. \n\n<br>\n\n## Post War\n\n<br>\n\n**<u>After WW2, Post-Cold War as U.S. and Russia diverged strategically, with Russia initially leaning towards NATO amid disintegration but later pivoting to the East due to China's rise, reshaping global power dynamics.</u>**\n\n<br>\n\n### Post-Cold War\n\n<br>\n\nPost cold war set the two major power seperately in East and West, so inevitably Sino-Soviet should deteriorate. \n\n<br>\n\nBetween 1950 and 1963, often dubbed the \"honeymoon period\" of Sino-Soviet relations, both nations inked a series of agreements spanning trade, higher education, nuclear technology, and industry. The Soviet Union's extensive support for China during this era included military involvement in the Korean War, where Chinese troops directly confronted the United Nations forces led by the United States. This shared military endeavor solidified China's international alignment towards the Soviet Union, albeit temporarily. However, the euphoria dissipated in 1963, when official negotiations in Moscow between the Soviet and Chinese Communist Parties acknowledged irreconcilable differences. The ensuing tension escalated into border conflicts and military clashes in 1969.\n\n<br>\n\nInevitably, after the rise of \"revised Sovietism\",  The Soviet Union deployed millions of troops in strategic locations, attempting to create a Sino-Soviet buffer zone. Ambitious endeavors in regions such as Outer Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Afghanistan underscored the geopolitical complexity. Meanwhile, Vietnam, under Le Duan's leadership, adopted a pro-Soviet, anti-Chinese stance. In response, China pursued diplomatic outreach to nations like Nepal and North Korea while fostering improved relations with Japan and the United States, particularly in the context of heightened tensions between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The United States wanted to contain the power of the Soviet Union.\n\n<br>\n\nThe U.S. extended Marshall Plans in the Western world, emphasizing long-term interests and the establishment of a new world order. Concurrently, the Soviet Union wielded force to redraw territorial lines. **<u>Current complex interplay between China and US echoed historical patterns</u>**, creating a global landscape not entirely divorced from its past, yet distinct in its own right. As the geopolitical chessboard continues to evolve, echoes of the past resonate in the present, shaping the intricate dance of nations on the world stage.\n\n<br>\n\n### Soviet Union's Disintegration\n\n<br>\n\nFollowing the Soviet Union's disintegration in 1991, Russia, under Yeltsin, faced economic challenges, political corruption, and regional issues like Chechen independence. Seeking stability, **<u>Yeltsin pursued a pro-Western strategy, expressing interest in joining NATO in 1991</u>**. However, Western \"shock therapy\" policies and perceived containment efforts strained relations. In 1999, NATO's bombing campaign in Yugoslavia deepened tensions, leading to Russia's failed attempt to join NATO.\n\n<br>\n\nPutin, succeeding Yeltsin, initially aimed to improve relations. In 2001, Russia reapplied to NATO, but under George W. Bush, the U.S. declared Russia a strategic competitor. NATO's eastward expansion intensified, fueling Russo-NATO tensions. Despite Putin's proposal in 2008 to join NATO, the U.S. remained skeptical, fearing impure motives. The Russo-Georgian War in 2008 further strained relations, dashing hopes of Russian NATO membership. NATO's continual expansion, coupled with U.S. hesitations, exacerbated tensions. \n\n<br>\n\n### Rise of China\n\n<br>\n\nNATO's continuous expansion, coupled with Western hesitation and the rise of China, exacerbated tensions, ultimately contributing to recent conflicts, including the war between Russia and Ukraine. Therefore, the war in Ukraine is not a whim, but a dynamic change in the entire East and West.\n\n<br>\n\nThe onset of the Russo-Ukrainian war has spurred Finland and Sweden's fervent desire to join NATO, indicating a shared perception of deteriorating international relations. Both nations, traditionally neutral, opt for NATO membership as a strategic move driven by the belief that a collective security framework is essential in the face of geopolitical uncertainties. This shift underscores a pragmatic calculation of common interests, as Finland and Sweden anticipate bilateral benefits within NATO rather than maintaining their traditional status as neutral countries. The quest for NATO membership reflects a strategic repositioning to navigate the changing dynamics of international relations amidst the Russo-Ukrainian conflict.\n\n<br>\n\n## Dependency Theory\n\n<br>\n\nExamining historical patterns, the recurring challenge in Eurasia lies in **<u>constant conflicts between core and peripheral countries.</u>** Peripheral nations, like Turkey and Hungary, find themselves in a delicate position, far from the centers of power. The optimal strategy for these countries involves avoiding allegiance to a single side forcefully. Instead, it is advantageous to weaken both sides unless crucial to a specific party. \n\n<br>\n\nLoyalty levels in the relationships between core and peripheral countries fluctuate. Marginalized nations, less favored, inevitably experience exploitation, conflicts, and shifts in their stance. National interests, often unspoken at the individual level, create a web of ever-changing relationships between countries.**<u> In this arena, there are no eternal friends, only eternal interests. </u>** The dynamics, be it war or trade frictions, are devoid of morality, driven solely by the responsibility to millions of people. Peace, in this context, rests on a nation's strength, not humanitarian ideals.\n\n<br>\n\nIn the quest for European hegemony, some countries find themselves stuck in the middle, distant from rising core nations, with their interests oscillating in uncertainty. Finland, wedged between Sweden and Tsarist Russia, or Poland and Ukraine, caught between Russia and Germany, exemplify this precarious positioning. Turkey, straddling Asia, Africa, and Europe, faces an even more complex geopolitical challenge. \n\n<br>\n\n**<u>Peripheral countries must strategically position themselves.</u>** Some, like Poland, lean towards pro-European and American stances, while others, like Finland and Sweden, traditionally preferred military neutrality. The Russo-Ukrainian war prompted Sweden to reconsider its alliance policy. \n\n<br>Alternatively, countries like Turkey may choose a disruptive path to maximize their interests, echoing the historical sentiment captured in the TV series \"Yes, Prime Minister\" regarding British foreign policy's goal of dividing Europe. \n\n<br>\n\nTV series lines as followed: Minister, Britain has had the same foreign policy objectives for at least the last 500 year to create a disunited Europe. In that cause, we have fought with the Dutch against the Spanish, with the Germans against the French, with the French and Italians against the Germans, and with the French against the Germans and Italians. Divide and rule , you see. We had to break the whole thing up, but that wouldn't work, so we had to get inside. The foreign office is pro-Europe, because its really anti-Europe. The civil service was united in its desire to make sure that common market didn't work, that's why we were into it. If not, why are we pressing for an increase in the membership? Well, for the same reason, it is just like the United Nations in fact. The more members it has, the more arquments it can stir up, the more futile and impotent it becomes. What appalling cynicism, which is called diplomacy. \n\n<br>\n\nCharacterizing pro-European actions as serving anti-European objectives may be biased. The European Union's common market indeed brings substantial benefits to its member states during favorable conditions. It facilitates market flow and fosters market expansion, enhancing economic prosperity. However, the fairness of the global landscape is multifaceted, akin to Germany's less-than-ideal geographical locationd during wartime, better than ideal during peacetime. To fully embrace the advantages of EU membership, member states must be prepared to make certain compromises when circumstances demand it.\n\n<br>\n\nNeutral countries, exemplified by Switzerland, employ an \"armed neutrality strategy. Switzerland, nestled between France and Germany, has perfected the art of neutrality, acting as a crucial buffer during times of conflict. Its strategic positioning allowed it to facilitate military preparations for both Germany and France, offering refuge to French nobles and safeguarding their assets. Switzerland, aware of its military limitations, builds itself into a hedgehog. Its armed populace, universal military service, and strategic Alpine location create a formidable defense. This neutral stance allows Switzerland to act as a buffer, deterring potential invaders by making conquest more costly than the gains. \n\n<br>\n\n**<u>So, the reason for why sweden wanna join NATO and the opposition to Sweden's NATO membership with Hungary and Turkey may rely on the both side intention of seeking greater interests.</u>** Excuses could be motivations may stem from response of Swedish comments for Hungary's democracy or Turkey's accusations against Sweden sheltering Kurdish militants. More specific, Turkey is negotiating for more F weapons from US for the vote of passing Sweden to joining NATO. The peripheral countries' goal remains securing resources amidst core countries' competition. Diplomatic relations and alliances may shift, demonstrating the pragmatic pursuit of national interests in a world dominated by the ebb and flow of geopolitical realities. \n\n<br>\n\n## Takeaways\n\n<br>\n\n**<u>Be more cautious for the potential escalating geopolitical issues.</u>** Examining the map, it's evident that the small marginal countries at the crossroads of the Eurasian continent are aligning with distinct sides, representing broader Eastern and Western forces led by the United States and China. The looming possibility of a conflict between these major powers, whether initiated by the dominant United States or challenged by the latecomer China, increases as compromise becomes elusive. Both sides may need a war to set the new order. Current events, such as the Hamas-Israel conflict, tensions in the Red Sea, and disputes in the Taiwan Strait, suggest a path toward realization. \n\n<br>\n\n**<u>Peace and Love. </u>** While nobody wishes for war, history has shown that it's an inevitable part of the human journey. In times of turmoil, peripheral countries prioritize their interests over emotions, ready to sever ties or forge close collaborations. The state machine, with its collective leadership, remains unwavering, serving the interests of millions. In this context, personal sentiments and moral unity take a back seat to the responsibility of individuals who contribute to the government, even as positions change. The country, acting as a rational entity, demands allegiance. For core countries, the pursuit of enduring love and peace remains paramount. Those in positions of influence bear the responsibility to extend kindness, having achieved their aspirations. A plea is made to contribute to global tranquility, recognizing the impact of their elevated positions on the world stage. In a world brimming with complexities, fostering peace becomes a shared imperative.\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n### Books to Read\n\nContinental power and maritime checks and balances\n\nWhy is Buddhism true?\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n---\n\n### \n","tags":["Events","Econ"],"categories":["Markets"]},{"title":"Econ Events - Why Argentina Needs Milei","url":"/2024/01/22/econ_jan22/","content":"\n# \n\n## Milei's Radical Agenda\n\n<br>Picture this: a presidential candidate emerges with a platform that is as unconventional as it is bold. This candidate champions ideas such as the dollarization of the economy, drastic cuts in state spending, opposition to established norms like sex education and legal abortion, legalization of organ selling, relaxation of gun control, and even drug legalization. In many countries, such propositions might be dismissed as too radical or contentious. Yet, in Argentina, this very set of proposals has propelled someone to the presidency. \n\n<br>\n\nThe question then arises: Why would the people of Argentina choose such a leader? It's a mistake to dismiss this decision as irrational. As an advocate for the rational actor hypothesis, I propose to delve into the complex web of reasons behind Javier Milei's ascent to power. What does his victory reveal about the current state of Argentina's society, economy, and political landscape? Let's explore the underlying factors that made Milei's presidency not just possible, but perhaps even inevitable. **<u>One sentence to summerize: when population are sick of both parties, they tend to vote for the unorthdox president who may have potential to rescue their life with radical proposal, including Argentina, Ukraine, etc. </u>** \n\n<br>\n\n## Argentina's Tumultuous Path\n\n<br>\n\nTracing Argentina's path to its current state requires a journey back in time, well before World War II. Known as the **World's Breadbasket**, Argentina boasted vast pampas, fertile lands, and a climate favorable for agriculture. During this era, its economy rivaled that of Britain and the emerging power of the United States.\n\n<br>\n\nHowever, despite avoiding direct involvement in World Wars I and II, Argentina couldn't escape economic turmoil. The withdrawal of British investments, which constituted a significant portion of its economy, exacerbated **Argentina's financial woes**. The country grappled with incomplete industrialization, relying heavily on imported agricultural machinery from Britain and the United States,highlighting the country's dependency on foreign technology.\n\n<br>\n\nWhen the populace struggles to meet basic needs such as food, a shift in governance becomes almost a certainty, mostly during financial crisis.  The ensuing era saw the rise of military governments. This period was marked by a strategic choice between authoritarianism and supporting unions to ensure political stability. The latter option was notably visible during **Peronism**. The government increased public spending and overhauled infrastructure for the populace's benefit, but these measures led to tight national finances and subsequent money printing. By around 1950, inflation in Argentina soared to 40%, outpacing wage growth, which lagged behind at 30%. This raises the question: Is the pursuit of social welfare without a robust economic foundation genuinely sustainable?\n\n<br>\n\nSuccessive governments post-Peronism continued to grapple with this **dilemma**, often opting to enhance national welfare to secure votes, despite the burgeoning fiscal deficit. This deficit was frequently addressed through increasing foreign debt. From 1990 to 2022, Argentina's total M2 money supply skyrocketed from 800 million to 134 trillion pesos. Repaying this debt through inflation led to extreme economic turbulence, culminating in a staggering 20,000% inflation rate post the Falklands War in 1982.\n\n<br>\n\nOver these tumultuous 70 years, Argentina's socio-economic landscape was primed for a radical change. This set the stage for the rise of Javier Milei, a candidate who capitalized on the public's growing discontent, eventually being elected as the new president with 56% support.\"\n\n<br>\n\n## The Roots of Milei's Triumph\n\n<br>\n\nJavier Milei is far from your typical politician. His eclectic background as a DJ, radio commentator, and football player, coupled with his forthright criticism of societal norms, government inaction, and Argentina's long-standing economic woes, sets him apart. **Milei's direct and unorthodox approach has resonated deeply with many Argentinians, his policies striking a chord in a society yearning for change.** His solutions to Argentina's challenges were radical yet straightforward: Rising Inflation? Response: Abolish the peso. Government Inefficiency? Response: Disband the government. Stagnant Wages? Response: Eliminate taxes. Economic Downturn? Response: Privatize state-owned assets. Social Security and Healthcare Concerns? Response: Legalize prostitution and organ selling, while upholding gun rights and opposing abortion.\n\n<br>\n\nThese policies, while controversial, seemed to offer a direct and immediate response to Argentina's deep-rooted problems. This boldness in policy-making positioned Milei not just as a leader but as a potential savior in the eyes of many. Was Milei's election a surprise? Not really. It appears more as a logical outcome under the circumstances. Faced with persisting errors in governance, it seems the electorate preferred to entrust the nation's future to an unconventional figure, embracing the potential for unforeseen outcomes over the continuation of known failures.\n\n<br>\n\nWait a second, Milei's approach echoes that of Margaret Thatcher during the Falklands War era. Thatcher's policies, focused on cutting social welfare, privatizing state assets, and boosting economic efficiency, were transformative for the UK, albeit with mixed outcomes. refine this expression :Mrs. Thatcher was the **savior of the capitalists** of that era, but she was also the **living judge of the miserable people**. Similarly, Milei's strategies might spur short-term enterprise growth in Argentina, akin to Thatcher's impact in the UK. However, there are concerns about the long-term consequences: increased wealth disparity, rising unemployment, diminished trade union rights, and potential social unrest.\n\n<br>\n\n**Power abhors a vacuum.** As the government recedes from key sectors under Milei's administration, unregulated capital, conglomerates, and even underground organizations might fill the void. The freedom to bear arms, as proposed by Milei, could instill a semblance of order, albeit outside the traditional governmental framework.\n\n<br>\n\nWhat lies ahead for Argentina and its people under Milei's leadership remains uncertain. Yet, every nation has its trials and tribulations. For Argentina, this may be a period of profound transformation – an epoch where resilience is tested, and new foundations are laid. As Argentina navigates these uncharted waters, one can only hope for a future that fortifies the nation without compromising its core values. \n\n<br>\n\n## God bless Argentina.\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n---\n\n### \n","tags":["Events","Econ"],"categories":["Markets"]},{"title":"Stocks Recap - Japanese Carmakers Excel, Auto Sector Challenges, TSM and ASML Lead","url":"/2024/01/21/stocks_jan21/","content":"\n# Summary\n\n- **For Carmakers, Japanese stocks, led by Toyota's 2.87% gains, outperformed as the US Federal Reserve's firm stance favored the market.

The resulting strengthening of the US dollar benefited Japan's export industry. On the flip side, Chinese carmakers, such as NIO and XPENG, experienced a notable decline, possibly linked to news of additional electric vehicle (EV) price cuts in Asia and Europe.\n\n<br>\n\nIn the US, the automotive sector, particularly EV companies like Rivian, faced challenges, evidenced by Rivian's eighth consecutive session of losses and a Deutsche Bank downgrade from Buy on concerns over near-term volume and margins.\n\n<br>**The upcoming US presidential election is crucial for investors,** as changes in the political landscape can impact environmental policies, regulatory frameworks, and trade negotiations. The potential disruption in federal support for the EV transition is a key concern, especially if a Republican-led administration revisits existing laws and funding.\n\n<br>\n\n**The US election impact on companies varies;** Tesla may face challenges due to potential policy changes affecting its Mexican plants, while Chinese carmakers could benefit from incentives and EV-related tax adjustments. Additionally, a GOP-led administration may roll back climate-friendly policies, favoring companies like Ford with slower transition strategies, including hybrids and plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) solutions.\n\n<br>\n\n### Biweekly Catalyst Highlights :\n\n<br>\n\n- Tesla enters earnings season.\n\n- Ford trims F-150 EV production, prioritizing Bronco and Ranger lines.\n\n- Electric vehicle sales in the EU decline for the first time since the pandemic.\n\n- Tesla plans a China tour for the Cybertruck.\n\n- VinFast Auto falls short of its 2023 delivery target.\n\n- Tesla reduces prices on select Model Ys in Europe.\n\n- Lamborghini achieves a milestone with a record 10,000 cars sold globally.\n\n- Elon Musk seeks 25% voting control in Tesla before advancing AI initiatives.\n\n- Chinese EV manufacturer BYD engages in discussions with Sigma Lithium.\n\n- Lucid issues a recall for 2,000 sedans due to a heating component concern.\n\n- Tesla temporarily closes its German factory amid Red Sea conflict disruptions.\n\n- European regulators intensify their investigation into Chinese automakers.\n\n- Lucid Group experiences an all-time low following the Q4 deliveries report.\n\n- Workhorse Group secures a second fleet order for the W56 step van.\n\n- Honda reenters the EV market with the new O series.\n\n- Tesla launches an upgraded Model 3 in North America with unchanged prices.\n\n- BYD Company begins selling electric vehicles in Indonesia starting this week.\n\n<br>\n\n| Stocks    | Friday's Close | Weekly | Monthly | YOY    |\n| --------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:------:|\n| BMW       | 33.76          | -4.77  | -8.78   | 3.40   |\n| BYD       | 25.35          | -6.11  | -3.06   | -12.82 |\n| FORD      | 11.20          | -2.27  | -6.82   | -3.39  |\n| GM        | 35.51          | 0.71   | -1.00   | -0.62  |\n| HONDA     | 32.36          | 0.65   | 7.19    | 36.77  |\n| LUCID     | 2.71           | -9.82  | -42.58  | -63.62 |\n| LI        | 28.24          | -10.77 | -19.93  | 32.46  |\n| NIO       | 6.06           | -15.48 | -31.29  | -43.73 |\n| RACE      | 349.41         | -0.54  | 0.22    | 46.82  |\n| RIVIN     | 15.48          | -14.29 | -36.43  | -1.96  |\n| TOYOTA    | 20.11          | 2.87   | 9.01    | 41.27  |\n| TSLA      | 212.19         | -3.06  | -17.51  | 66.86  |\n| VINFAST   | 6.00           | -8.95  | -25.00  | -40.54 |\n| VWAGY     | 12.70          | -3.27  | -5.72   | -25.54 |\n| WORKHORSE | 0.28           | -11.74 | -19.43  | -85.61 |\n| XPENG     | 9.64           | -18.10 | -34.82  | 7.71   |\n\n<br>\n\n### HIDDEN CHAMPION :\n\n<br>\n\n**TSM and ASML emerged as top performers among EV suppliers this week.** In this week's portfolio, TSM (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) and ASML stand out among EV suppliers, showcasing impressive gains of 12% and 6% respectively.

On the flip side, a robust rebound was hindered by abundant stocks in major global warehouses. Data from the Shanghai Futures Exchange revealed an 8% increase in inventories in key Chinese warehouses, reaching 33,130 tonnes in the first week of January. The delicate balance between economic uncertainties and inventory levels continues to influence the trajectory of copper and raises cautious optimism about the commodity's near-term performance.\n\n<br>\n\n**Aluminum futures extended their decline to under $2,178 per tonne cuz of the resumed supply from Guinea.**  The earlier surge last year was due to a bauxite supply disruption from Guinea, the world's third-largest bauxite exporter. An explosion at a fuel depot in Guinea halted industrial activity, driving aluminum prices up. The recent retreat can be attributed to strong investments from the UAE in the infrastructure sector, alleviating investor concerns. Additionally, the People's Bank of China's (PBOC) policy to inject 350 billion into state banks is expected to bolster manufacturing activity, providing short-term support to aluminum prices.\n\n<br>\n\n**Nickel futures continued its decline for oversupply concerns.** Nickel futures fell below $16,500 per tonne, nearing three-year lows, due to abundant supply from top producers—Indonesia, Philippines, and China. The International Nickel Study Group forecasts a surplus of 223,000 metric tons in 2023, with expectations of widening to 239,000 metric tons in 2024, emphasizing the persistent imbalance between supply and demand in the nickel market.\n\n<br>\n\n**Tin futures rebounded to 24,780 from the one-month low of 24,430 touched on January 10th, but still at a high level, influenced by lingering expectations for stronger supply, following a three-month high of $25,680 reached on December 28th.** Tin prices were upheld by the prolonged production halt in Myanmar's Wa region since August, responsible for 70% of Myanmar's output and a significant portion of China's tin supply. With China compelled to seek alternative sources, the Republic of Congo became a primary supplier. However, adverse weather conditions and infrastructure challenges in Congo towards the end of the year hampered output, contributing to elevated tin prices in the market.\n\n<br>\n\n**Lithium dip this week in such restocking season.** Lithium carbonate prices, hitting CNY 95,500 per tonne since last week, as the market somewhat found an equilibrium of ample supply and muted demand, which marked the lowest since August 2021, plummeting over 80% in the past year due to an escalating oversupply. Pessimism surrounding electric vehicle sales in China constrained lithium demand during the typical restocking season for battery manufacturers. Consequently, major industry players now project the next lithium deficit to emerge only in 2028, a sharp departure from earlier expectations. Previous investments aimed at increasing supply may propel the global carbonate equivalent supply to surge by 40% in 2024, as per UBS, intensifying the existing surplus.\n\n<br>\n\n| Future   | Friday's Close | Weekly | Monthly | YOY    |\n| -------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:------:|\n| Copper   | 3.78           | 1.26   | -2.81   | -10.92 |\n| Aluminum | 2178           | -1.87  | -2.81   | -16.57 |\n| Zinc     | 2473           | -1.63  | -3.89   | -27.70 |\n| Nickel   | 15918          | -1.61  | -3.63   | -45.39 |\n| Tin      | 25233          | 3.27   | 1.66    | -13.29 |\n| Lithium  | 95500          | 0      | -2.05   | -80.00 |\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n### Agriculture :\n\n<br>\n\n**Soybean futures drop on oversupply.** Soybean futures dropped to $12.2 per bushel this week, marking the lowest point in almost three months and extending a 15.1% loss from 2023 due to anticipated robust production. Despite weather challenges, Brazil is poised for a record-breaking soybean harvest. Additionally, Argentina is exploring the potential to double its soybean output, while Paraguay and Uruguay also indicate substantial increases.\n\n<br>\n\n**Wheat futures saw a decline, slipping below $5.93 per bushel in January, marking the lowest point in over a month.** The drop is attributed to sustained expectations of robust global supply. The USDA's upward revision of global wheat supply forecasts for the current marketing year, driven by increased production and beginning stocks, played a significant role. Ample stocks in Ukrainian silos, coupled with higher production in Russia reaching 91 million tonnes, just shy of the record set last year, contributed to an all-time high of 51 million tonnes available for export. This substantial surplus, combined with strong harvests in Canada and Australia, resulted in heightened export forecasts, solidifying the position of these key producers in the global wheat market.\n\n<br>**Malaysian palm oil futures held steady around MYR 3,939 per tonne, marking the seventh consecutive session of gains and reaching a six-week high.** This upward trajectory is attributed to the strength in rival edible oils on the Chicago Board of Trade and an increase in crude oil prices amid deepening Middle East tensions. The weekly performance reflects a nearly 2% jump, driven by growing speculation that India, a major buyer, may escalate palm oil purchases due to concerns over the availability of sunflower and soybean oils amid tensions in the Red Sea. The confluence of global factors and regional demand fears continues to propel Malaysian palm oil futures to higher levels.\n\n<br>\n\n| Future   | Friday's Close | Weekly | Monthly | YOY    |\n| -------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:------:|\n| Soybeans | 1213           | -0.09  | -7.79   | -19.47 |\n| Wheat    | 593            | -0.05  | -2.79   | -20.03 |\n| Palm Oil | 3939           | 2.15   | 4.26    | 1.21   |\n\n---\n\n<br>\n","tags":["Commodity","Weekly Recap"],"categories":["Markets"]},{"title":"Regional Markets - Currency Declined As Dollar Strengthed","url":"/2024/01/20/mmarket_jan20/","content":"\n# Summary\n\n- **In the emerging markets, most currencies faced decline due to the strengthened dollar resulting from a hawkish Fed Reserve governor.Mexico's peso faces pressure on policy outlook, while Brazil grapples with industrial contraction.** \n\n- **The Indian rupee held firm amid global uncertainties, benefiting from strong domestic economic data and central bank intervention.

The 7.3% GDP growth in the 2023-24 fiscal year surpassed expectations, reinforcing positive sentiments for Indian equities and sovereign debt. Meanwhile, the index faced a 1.2% decline for the week, influenced by global concerns over delayed rate cuts and rising Middle East tensions.\n\n<br>\n\n| Markets | Friday's Close | Weekly | Monthly | YOY   |\n| ------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:-----:|\n| USD/INR | 83.08          | 0.28   | -0.06   | 2.60  |\n| SENSEX  | 71683          | -1.22  | 1.67    | 18.25 |\n\n<br>\n\n### EU :<br><br>\n\n### Russia\n\n**Russian currency and index react positively to strengthed dollar and geopolitical tension in Yemen.** The Russian ruble eased to approximately 89 per USD as profit-taking ensued following a recent rally, reaching its highest levels in over six months. The Russian finance ministry shifted to forex sales, planning to sell 16.7 billion rubles ($189.5 million) daily in the latter half of January. The ruble-based MOEX Russia index, which had surged to 1-1/2-month highs, declined to 3166 on Friday for a second consecutive session. Mixed dynamics were observed over the week, with all sectors ending in the red amid reduced investor activity and a light macroeconomic agenda.\n\n<br>\n\n### Turkey\n\n**The Turkish lira continued its downward spiral** reaching an unprecedented low of 30.2 per USD, prompted by remarks from central bank chief Erkan signaling an early end to the monetary policy tightening cycle and strengthed dollar. Despite Turkey's annual inflation soaring to an alarming 64.77% in December, with expectations of a continued upward trajectory in the coming months, Erkan's comments added to concerns. The substantial increase in the minimum wage, a contributing factor to inflation, aimed at alleviating living costs ahead of the upcoming municipal elections in March. With the net minimum wage for 2024 raised to 17,002 liras ($578), the Turkish lira has witnessed a staggering decline of over a third in the past year and more than 80% over the last five years, reflecting the deepening economic challenges facing Turkey.\n\n<br>\n\n| Markets  | Friday's Close | Weekly | Monthly | YOY   |\n| -------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:-----:|\n| USD/RUB  | 88.17          | 0.24   | -1.65   | 29.20 |\n| USD/TRY  | 30.20          | 0.48   | 3.77    | 61.05 |\n| MOEX     | 3166           | -0.59  | 1.99    | 46.14 |\n| BIST 100 | 7997           | 0.13   | 4.36    | 45.65 |\n| TURKEY-B | 24.88          | 0.57   | 2.32    | 14.96 |\n\n<br><br>\n\n### Other Markets :\n\n| Markets | Friday's Close | Weekly | Monthly | YOY   |\n| ------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:-----:|\n| USD/CHF | 0.86           | 1.85   | 0.63    | -5.69 |\n| USD/KRW | 1333           | 1.56   | 2.35    | 8.53  |\n| USD/NGN | 890            | -7.00  | 8.01    | 95.80 |\n| USD/ZAR | 19             | 2.24   | 3.85    | 11.20 |\n| TAIEX   | 17682          | 0.96   | 0.26    | 14.12 |\n| NSE     | 94538          | 13.84  | 28.80   | 79.75 |\n\n---\n","tags":["Weekly Recap","Regional Markets"],"categories":["Markets"]},{"title":"Markets Recap - Navigate Earnings Impact, Central Bank Signals","url":"/2024/01/20/macro_jan20/","content":"\n# Summary\n\n- **U.S. markets fluctuated on early earnings impact, tech resilience lifted stocks, bond rates stabilized on FED signals.European stocks faced declines amid a hawkish ECB stance and mixed economic signals.** \n\n- **Japan's stock market surged on a weakening yen and positive inflation data, while China faced unexpected declines due to weak economic indicators.**\n\n- **The dollar strengthened, buoyed by robust US data and a hawkish Fed, impacting the yen, which weakened as Finance Minister Suzuki emphasized stable currency moves; oil prices held gains amid Middle East tensions and positive demand outlook, while gold declined on strengthened dollar and Treasury yields.**   \n\n<br>\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n### US Market : <br><br>\n\n**The U.S. stock market witnessed volatility as the fourth-quarter earnings season unfolded.** Boeing's earnings report, coupled with delivery concerns for its 737 MAX airliners, initially led to declines.

However, Japan's bond market saw upward pressure on yields due to a more hawkish tone from US Federal Reserve officials. The 10-year Japanese government bond yield rose to 0.66%. Becuase of signs of easing inflationary pressure, the Bank of Japan is more likelt to maintain its monetary policy stance.\n\n<br>\n\n**Persistent concerns about the economy continued to weigh on the stock market.** Economic indicators painted a bleak outlook, leading to concerns about the country's economic trajectory. In the bond market, the People's Bank of China injected an above-forecast RMB 995 billion to boost demand, reflecting anticipation of potential policy loosening in the coming year.\n\n<br>\n\n**Economic Data :** \n\n<br>\n\n- Japan's economic data revealed a mixed picture, with core consumer price index (CPI) slowing to 2.3% in December, signaling a predicted slowdown in consumer inflation. \n\n- Retail sales in China, growing 7.4% in December, fell short of expectations, while fixed-asset investment exceeded forecasts at 3.0% for the full year, driven by infrastructure growth. \n\n- A deepening decline in real estate investment posed challenges. December industrial production surpassed expectations, but urban unemployment inched up to 5.1% from November's 5.0%, adding complexities to the economic narrative.\n\n- China’s new home prices fell 0.4% in December, down from November’s 0.3% decline\n\n<br>\n\n| Index     | Friday's Close | Weekly | Monthly | YOY    |\n| --------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:------:|\n| NIKKEI    | 36273          | 1.96   | 7.71    | 36.60  |\n| SSE SH    | 2832           | -1.72  | -2.41   | -13.25 |\n| CSI 300   | 3270           | -0.44  | -0.84   | -13.25 |\n| Hang Seng | 15309          | -5.76  | -7.86   | -30.56 |\n\n<br><br>\n\n### Other Markets :<br><br>\n\n**In the forex market, the dollar index held steady around 103.3,** securing a weekly gain propelled by robust US data and a hawkish stance from Federal Reserve officials, diminishing expectations of a March interest rate cut. The yen weakened against the dollar, reaching JPY 148, prompting Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki to emphasize the government's vigilance on currency moves.\n\n<br>\n\n**Oil prices experienced slight declines but maintained a weekly gain,** with WTI crude futures at approximately $73.7 per barrel. Escalating Middle East tensions and a positive global oil demand outlook supported the market.

The precious metals were buoyed by a subdued dollar and decreased treasury yields, fueled by lower-than-expected producer inflation in the U.S. This data intensified expectations of earlier monetary easing by the Federal Reserve. Notably, on Friday, escalating conflict in the Middle East, marked by a U.S.-led coalition launching multiple attacks on Houthi targets in Yemen, further heightened safe-haven demand for gold. The combination of economic factors and geopolitical tensions continues to drive the upward trajectory of these precious metals.\n\n<br>\n\n| Future | Friday's Close | Weekly | Monthly | YOY   |\n| ------ |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:-----:|\n| Gold   | 2048           | 0.17   | 1.05    | 6.70  |\n| Silver | 23.19          | 0.12   | -2.35   | -4.37 |\n\n<br>\n\n### Base Metals :\n\n<br>\n\n**Copper futures experienced a slight decline this week** dipping below the $3.8 per pound level with a 1.14% drop. Despite the People's Bank of China injecting CNY 350 billion into other state policy banks, indicating continued government support for the economy, investor caution persists regarding China's recovery. On the flip side, a robust rebound was hindered by abundant stocks in major global warehouses. Data from the Shanghai Futures Exchange revealed an 8% increase in inventories in key Chinese warehouses, reaching 33,130 tonnes in the first week of January. The delicate balance between economic uncertainties and inventory levels continues to influence the trajectory of copper and raises cautious optimism about the commodity's near-term performance.\n\n<br>\n\n**Aluminum futures extended their decline to under $2,250 per tonne**  The earlier surge last year was due to a bauxite supply disruption from Guinea, the world's third-largest bauxite exporter. An explosion at a fuel depot in Guinea halted industrial activity, driving aluminum prices up. The recent retreat can be attributed to strong investments from the UAE in the infrastructure sector, alleviating investor concerns. Additionally, the People's Bank of China's (PBOC) policy to inject 350 billion into state banks is expected to bolster manufacturing activity, providing short-term support to aluminum prices.\n\n<br>\n\n**Nickel futures continued its decline for oversupply concerns.** Nickel futures fell below $16,500 per tonne, nearing three-year lows, due to abundant supply from top producers—Indonesia, Philippines, and China. The International Nickel Study Group forecasts a surplus of 223,000 metric tons in 2023, with expectations of widening to 239,000 metric tons in 2024, emphasizing the persistent imbalance between supply and demand in the nickel market.\n\n<br>\n\n**Tin continued its decline for oversupply concerns.** Tin futures experienced a dip this week below 24,500, influenced by lingering expectations for stronger supply, following a three-month high of $25,680 reached on December 28th. Tin prices were upheld by the prolonged production halt in Myanmar's Wa region since August, responsible for 70% of Myanmar's output and a significant portion of China's tin supply. With China compelled to seek alternative sources, the Republic of Congo became a primary supplier. However, adverse weather conditions and infrastructure challenges in Congo towards the end of the year hampered output, contributing to elevated tin prices in the market.\n\n<br>\n\n**Lithium dip this week in such restocking season.** Lithium carbonate prices, hitting CNY 95,500 per tonne this week, as the market somewhat found an equilibrium of ample supply and muted demand, which marked the lowest since August 2021, plummeting over 80% in the past year due to an escalating oversupply. Pessimism surrounding electric vehicle sales in China constrained lithium demand during the typical restocking season for battery manufacturers. Consequently, major industry players now project the next lithium deficit to emerge only in 2028, a sharp departure from earlier expectations. Previous investments aimed at increasing supply may propel the global carbonate equivalent supply to surge by 40% in 2024, as per UBS, intensifying the existing surplus.\n\n<br>\n\n| Future   | Friday's Close | Weekly | Monthly | YOY    |\n| -------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:------:|\n| Copper   | 3.74           | -1.14  | -1.14   | -11.11 |\n| Aluminum | 2219           | -2.40  | 3.69    | -14.49 |\n| Zinc     | 2513           | -1.93  | 3.56    | -24.40 |\n| Nickel   | 16189          | 0.09   | -1.22   | -39.67 |\n| Tin      | 24435          | -3.40  | 0.31    | -8.87  |\n| Lithium  | 95500          | -1.04  | -2.05   | -80.12 |\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n### Agriculture :\n\n<br>\n\n**Soybean futures drop on oversupply.** Soybean futures dropped to $12.2 per bushel this week, marking the lowest point in almost three months and extending a 15.1% loss from 2023 due to anticipated robust production. Despite weather challenges, Brazil is poised for a record-breaking soybean harvest. Additionally, Argentina is exploring the potential to double its soybean output, while Paraguay and Uruguay also indicate substantial increases.\n\n<br>\n\n**Wheat futures saw a decline, slipping below $5.95 per bushel in January, marking the lowest point in over a month.** The drop is attributed to sustained expectations of robust global supply. The USDA's upward revision of global wheat supply forecasts for the current marketing year, driven by increased production and beginning stocks, played a significant role. Ample stocks in Ukrainian silos, coupled with higher production in Russia reaching 91 million tonnes, just shy of the record set last year, contributed to an all-time high of 51 million tonnes available for export. This substantial surplus, combined with strong harvests in Canada and Australia, resulted in heightened export forecasts, solidifying the position of these key producers in the global wheat market.\n\n<br>**Malaysian palm oil futures held steady around MYR 3,856 per tonne, marking the seventh consecutive session of gains and reaching a five-week high.** This upward trajectory is attributed to the strength in rival edible oils on the Chicago Board of Trade and an increase in crude oil prices amid deepening Middle East tensions. The weekly performance reflects a nearly 4% jump, driven by growing speculation that India, a major buyer, may escalate palm oil purchases due to concerns over the availability of sunflower and soybean oils amid tensions in the Red Sea. The confluence of global factors and regional demand fears continues to propel Malaysian palm oil futures to higher levels.\n\n<br>\n\n| Future   | Friday's Close | Weekly | Monthly | YOY    |\n| -------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:------:|\n| Soybeans | 1223           | -2.65  | -7.79   | -19.95 |\n| Wheat    | 596            | -3.25  | -1.53   | -19.87 |\n| Palm Oil | 3856           | 4.73   | 5.07    | 0.39   |\n\n---\n\n<br>\n","tags":["Commodity","Weekly Recap"],"categories":["Markets"]},{"title":"Regional Markets - Resilience and Challenges Across Brazil, Mexico, India, Russia, and Turkey","url":"/2024/01/13/mmarket_jan14/","content":"\n# Summary\n\n- **Brazil and Mexico exhibited distinct paths.

Russia's ruble strengthened past 89 per USD due to central bank actions and rising oil prices from geopolitical events. In contrast, Turkey faced economic challenges, with the lira hitting a record low of 30.1 per USD, triggered by central bank signals, surging inflation, and a substantial minimum wage increase.** \n\n<br>\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n### Latin America : <br><br>\n\n### Brazil\n\n**Brazil's resilient real amid trade surplus despite economic challenges.** In Brazil, the recent PMI reading for December pointed to a contraction, primarily fueled by ongoing declines in operating conditions and heightened cost pressures. Headline inflation, standing at 4.62% in December, surpassed market expectations of 4.54%. While the central bank is anticipated to implement its fifth consecutive 50bps cut this month, the persistent risk of upside price growth may prompt policymakers to temper their dovish signals, leading to a potentially more cautious approach to Brazilian disinflation. This shift in expectations toward a more hawkish stance was evident in the currency market, where the real appreciated by 0.42% against the US dollar this week. Additionally, for the long term, Brazil's currency exhibited resilience, attributed to the country's record trade surplus of $98.8 billion in 2023, marking a substantial 60.6% increase from the previous year. This surplus, driven by expanded exports in agriculture and extractive industries, has not only bolstered foreign currency inflows but also contributed to the strength of the real. As Brazil navigates these economic challenges, policymakers face a delicate balance in responding to both contractionary forces and inflationary pressures.\n\n<br>\n\nThe Ibovespa, however, experienced a 0.7% loss, initially influenced by lower oil prices earlier in the week. The later disruption of commercial routes in the Red Sea due to U.S. and UK airstrikes on Houthi targets in Yemen led to a surge in oil prices by week-end, benefitting Petrobras and ultimately contributing to a 0.3% increase in the Ibovespa.\n\n<br>\n\n### Mexico\n\n**In Mexico, mirroring the trend in Brazil, the Mexican peso strengthened, surpassing the 16.86 per USD level.** December's inflation data revealed a month-over-month headline inflation of 0.7%, with a year-over-year rate of 4.7%, slightly exceeding expectations. The central bank is anticipated to maintain a vigilant stance against broader inflation, signaling a reluctance for immediate interest rate cuts until sustained signs of longer-lasting disinflation emerge. Concurrently, the World Bank adjusted Mexico's growth projection for 2024, elevating it from 1.9% to a more optimistic 2.6%. This adjustment underscores the resilience of the Mexican economy in the face of aggressive rate hikes in the previous year, providing a positive outlook for the nation's economic trajectory.<br>\n\nRecent economic indicators further underscored the resilience of the Mexican economy, with business confidence reaching a ten-year high. Additionally, unemployment remained at levels unseen in over twenty years. These factors collectively contribute to a favorable outlook for Mexico's economic stability and growth.\n\n<br>\n\n### Argentina\n\nThe USD to ARS exchange rate increased by 0.07% on Friday for the week. Notably, Argentina's main stock market index, Merval, declined 2.11% this week. \n\n<br>\n\n| Markets    | Friday's Close | Weekly | Monthly | YOY    |\n| ---------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:------:|\n| USD/BRL    | 4.85           | -0.42  | -1.34   | -4.74  |\n| USD/MXN    | 16.86          | -0.03  | -2.17   | -11.09 |\n| USD/ARS    | 816            | 0.47   | 2.01    | 350.21 |\n| IBOVESPA   | 130988         | -0.78  | 1.18    | 18.10  |\n| IPC MEXICO | 55607          | -1.04  | 0.80    | 3.79   |\n| MERVAL     | 1033123        | -2.11  | 2.95    | 326.64 |\n| BRAZIL-B   | 10.59          | 0.02   | -0.32   | -1.72  |\n| MEXICO     | 8.95           | -0.02  | -0.15   | 0.48   |\n\n<br>\n\n### Asia :<br><br>\n\n### India\n\n**Rupee continued its momentum.** In India, the momentum of the Indian rupee continued, appreciating beyond 83 per USD, marking its strongest position in four months. This strengthening trend is attributed to robust economic data and sustained intervention by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). India's GDP growth stood at an impressive 7.3% in the 2023-24 fiscal year, surpassing market expectations and highlighting the resilience of the Indian economy amidst the RBI's tightening cycle in the preceding year. The RBI's consistent intervention in the foreign exchange markets, preventing the rupee from breaching its record low of 83.4, has instilled confidence in investors. This proactive approach by the central bank has contributed to the rupee's positive trajectory, signaling a favorable outlook for India's economic stability.\n\n<br>\n\nThe S&P BSE Sensex climbed 1.2% to close at an all-time high of 72,568 points on Friday, and the NSE Nifty 50 surged by 1.1% to end at a record 21,895 points, led by increases in IT companies, supported by positive quarterly reports from both Tata Consultancy Services and Infosys.\n\n<br>\n\n| Markets | Friday's Close | Weekly | Monthly | YOY   |\n| ------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:-----:|\n| USD/INR | 82.85          | -0.29  | -0.59   | 1.94  |\n| SENSEX  | 72568          | 0.75   | 4.29    | 20.24 |\n\n<br>\n\n### EU :<br><br>\n\n### Russia\n\n**Russian currency and index react positively to the geopolitical tension.** The Russian ruble crossed the 89 per USD mark, reaching its highest level since November's end, propelled by intensified interventions by the central bank and a surge in oil prices following U.S. and UK missile strikes in Yemen. Additionally, the Russian finance ministry announced a shift from forex purchases to sales in the coming weeks, aiming to offset lower revenues from oil and gas in the past month. Higher oil prices, further boosted by Western strikes on Houthi military targets in Yemen, contributed to the positive momentum, reflecting the intricate interplay of global events impacting Russia's currency and economic indicators.\n\n<br>\n\n### Turkey\n\n**The Turkish lira continued its downward spiral** reaching an unprecedented low of 30.1 per USD, prompted by remarks from central bank chief Erkan signaling an early end to the monetary policy tightening cycle. Despite Turkey's annual inflation soaring to an alarming 64.77% in December, with expectations of a continued upward trajectory in the coming months, Erkan's comments added to concerns. The substantial increase in the minimum wage, a contributing factor to inflation, aimed at alleviating living costs ahead of the upcoming municipal elections in March. With the net minimum wage for 2024 raised to 17,002 liras ($578), the Turkish lira has witnessed a staggering decline of over a third in the past year and more than 80% over the last five years, reflecting the deepening economic challenges facing Turkey.\n\n<br>\n\n| Markets  | Friday's Close | Weekly | Monthly | YOY   |\n| -------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:-----:|\n| USD/RUB  | 87.95          | -3.26  | -1.56   | 35.32 |\n| USD/TRY  | 30.11          | 0.97   | 4.02    | 60.32 |\n| MOEX     | 3186           | 1.56   | 5.06    | 44.45 |\n| BIST 100 | 7986           | 4.69   | 6.07    | 60.81 |\n| TURKEY-B | 24.31          | -1.16  | 1.04    | 14.16 |\n\n<br><br>\n\n### Other Markets :\n\n| Markets | Friday's Close | Weekly | Monthly | YOY    |\n| ------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:------:|\n| USD/CHF | 0.85           | 0.22   | -2.17   | -7.98  |\n| USD/KRW | 1312           | -0.13  | 1.36    | 6.08   |\n| USD/NGN | 957            | 4.82   | 19.33   | 111.68 |\n| USD/ZAR | 18.64          | -0.17  | -0.17   | 11.06  |\n| TAIEX   | 17513          | -0.04  | 0.35    | 18.89  |\n| NSE     | 83043          | 4.24   | 14.86   | 58.53  |\n\n---\n","tags":["Weekly Recap","Regional Markets"],"categories":["Markets"]},{"title":"Markets Recap - US Tech-Driven Resilience, EU Rate Speculation, and Diverging Trends in Asia","url":"/2024/01/13/macro_jan13/","content":"\n# Summary\n\n- **US stocks remained resilient, driven by tech gains, while bond markets fluctuated around expectations of softened financial conditions.

Energy stocks, however, underperformed as early-week pullbacks in oil prices impacted the sector. The week marked the unofficial start of earnings season, featuring reports from major banks—JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo—revealing their fourth-quarter results on Friday. Tesla faced a 3.6% decline following the announcement of a production halt in its Berlin plant due to conflicts in the Red Sea, prompting shifts in transport routes. The upcoming closure of markets on Monday for Martin Luther King, Jr. Day added a note of anticipation.\n\n<br>\n\n**In the bond markets, the yield on the 10-year US Treasury note edged towards 3.97%** retracting from a three-week high of 4.04% on January 5th.

Major stock indexes presented a mixed picture, influenced notably by a dovish stance from ECB policymakers. Germany’s DAX recorded a gain of 0.66%, France’s CAC 40 Index inched up by 0.06%, and Italy’s FTSE MIB showed modest upward movement.<br>\n\n**The bond market in Europe experienced volatility** particularly following an interview on Thursday where ECB President Christine Lagarde suggested that the most challenging phase of inflation might be behind, hinting at potential interest rate cuts if inflation falls to the 2% level. This led to fluctuations in yields, with the German 10-year Bund yield retracting below 2.2%.

These levels marked their highest in almost 34 years, propelled by a weak yen and the Bank of Japan's dovish monetary policy stance. The BoJ reiterated its commitment to maintaining an ultra-accommodative policy until sustainable inflation, driven by wage growth, materializes. The 10-year Japanese government bond yield struggled to find clear direction, fluctuating around 0.6% throughout the week.<br>\n\n**Persistent concerns about the economy continued to weigh on the stock market.** The Shanghai Composite Index declined by 1.61%, and the blue-chip CSI 300 gave up 1.35%. In Hong Kong, the benchmark Hang Seng Index fell by 1.76%, according to FactSet.<br>\n\n**Economic Data :** <br>\n\n- In China, economic indicators reflected ongoing deflationary pressures, with the consumer price index falling by 0.3% in December, marking the third consecutive monthly decline.\n\n- The producer price index declined by 2.7% from a year ago, a slight improvement from November's 3%, marking the 15th consecutive monthly decline.

Despite the market pricing in an 80% chance of a rate cut in March, the Eurozone, with a more conservative 30% probability, is leaning towards holding rates higher for a longer duration. The euro stabilized above $1.09 with slight gains, reflecting a nuanced market sentiment. Concurrently, the yen lingered at its lowest levels in around a month, weakening beyond JPY 145 against the U.S. dollar, influenced by the Bank of Japan's commitment to maintaining its current monetary policy stance.<br>\n\n**Oil prices exhibited volatility throughout the week.** A more than 2% decline on Monday resulted from sharp price cuts by top exporter Saudi Arabia and increased OPEC output. However, a Friday surge of over 1% followed concerns of potential supply disruptions due to U.S. and British air and sea strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen. These geopolitical developments underscored the delicate balance influencing oil market dynamics.<br>\n\n**Cryptocurrency markets experienced heightened volatility, driven by a mix of fake news regarding ETF rejections and real approvals that supported the market.** Ethereum saw notable gains, surging over 10% weekly.

Meanwhile, wheat rebounded on new purchases, and Malaysian palm oil retreated due to reduced inventories from weather-related constraints, introducing specific circumstances for these commodities.** \n\n<br>\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n### Precious Metals :\n\n<br>\n\n**Gold & silver price slips.** The strength of the US dollar had a ripple effect on other asset classes. Gold prices slipped as the dollar strengthened. Silver prices dips below $23 per ounce. In the Eurozone, inflation increased to 2.9% in December from November's 2.4%, slightly below the anticipated 3%. \n\n<br>\n\n| Future | Friday's Close | Weekly | M     | YTD   |\n| ------ |:--------------:|:------:|:-----:|:-----:|\n| Gold   | 2044.96        | -0.83  | 1.01  | 9.63  |\n| Silver | 23.14          | -2.45  | -2.91 | -2.67 |\n\n<br>\n\n### ###  Base Metals :\n\n<br>\n\n**Copper & Zinc prices dip on dollar strength and weak China PMI data.** Copper futures experienced a decline to 3.9 per pound in January, stepping back from the five-month peak of $3.95 recorded on December 27th. This retreat was influenced by a resurgence in the US dollar, which exerted downward pressure on commodity prices. Additionally, profit-taking activities by commodity trading firms contributed to the dip in copper futures. The subdued demand from China further exacerbated the situation, marked by a fourth consecutive month of low Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) readings according to Caixin data. These factors collectively contributed to the weakening of copper prices in the market. \n\n<br>\n\n**Aluminum retreats on supply enhancement, investments, and PBOC support.**  Aluminum futures dropped below 2300 from the eight-month high of 2387 last week in 2023. The earlier surge was due to a bauxite supply disruption from Guinea, the world's third-largest bauxite exporter. An explosion at a fuel depot in Guinea halted industrial activity, driving aluminum prices up. The recent retreat can be attributed to strong investments from the UAE in the infrastructure sector, alleviating investor concerns. Additionally, the People's Bank of China's (PBOC) policy to inject 350 billion into state banks is expected to bolster manufacturing activity, providing short-term support to aluminum prices.\n\n<br>\n\n**Nickel futures dip on oversupply concerns.** Nickel futures fell below $16,500 per tonne, nearing three-year lows, due to abundant supply from top producers—Indonesia, Philippines, and China. The International Nickel Study Group forecasts a surplus of 223,000 metric tons in 2023, with expectations of widening to 239,000 metric tons in 2024, emphasizing the persistent imbalance between supply and demand in the nickel market.\n\n<br>\n\n**Tin dips on dollar strength, easing supply.** Tin futures experienced a dip in the first week, influenced by a strengthening dollar and easing supply concerns from the previous year, following a three-month high of $25,680 reached on December 28th. Despite the decline, tin prices were upheld by the prolonged production halt in Myanmar's Wa region since August, responsible for 70% of Myanmar's output and a significant portion of China's tin supply. With China compelled to seek alternative sources, the Republic of Congo became a primary supplier. However, adverse weather conditions and infrastructure challenges in Congo towards the end of the year hampered output, contributing to elevated tin prices in the market.\n\n<br>\n\n**Lithium remained unchanged this week in such restocking season.** Lithium carbonate prices, hitting CNY 97,500 per tonne in January, marked the lowest since August 2021, plummeting over 80% in the past year due to an escalating oversupply. Pessimism surrounding electric vehicle sales in China constrained lithium demand during the typical restocking season for battery manufacturers. Consequently, major industry players now project the next lithium deficit to emerge only in 2028, a sharp departure from earlier expectations. Previous investments aimed at increasing supply may propel the global carbonate equivalent supply to surge by 40% in 2024, as per UBS, intensifying the existing surplus.\n\n<br>\n\n| Future   | Friday's Close | Weekly | Monthly | YTD    |\n| -------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:------:|\n| Copper   | 3.79           | -2.45  | 1.87    | -3.21  |\n| Aluminum | 2274.50        | -4.59  | 5.86    | -0.91  |\n| Zinc     | 2550.99        | -4.06  | 5.00    | -15.66 |\n| Nickel   | 15835          | -4.02  | -0.66   | -42.62 |\n| Tin      | 24834          | -3.16  | 3.20    | -1.04  |\n| Lithium  | 96500          | 0      | -2.03   | -80.80 |\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n### Agriculture :\n\n<br>\n\n**Soybean futures drop on oversupply.** Soybean futures dropped to $12.6 per bushel in the first week, marking the lowest point in almost three months and extending a 15.1% loss from 2023 due to anticipated robust production. Despite weather challenges, Brazil is poised for a record-breaking soybean harvest. Additionally, Argentina is exploring the potential to double its soybean output, while Paraguay and Uruguay also indicate substantial increases.\n\n<br>\n\n**Wheat futures rebound a little bit on buyer's purchases.** Wheat futures climbed above6.2 per bushel, recovering from the one-month low of 6 on January 3rd, following reports of new purchases from major consumers. The announcement that China was seeking another round of US wheat spurred buying activity from commodity funds. This potential purchase builds on a similar transaction at the end of November, which previously boosted the benchmark to $6.4.\n\n<br>**Plam oil retreated.** Malaysian palm oil futures hovered around MYR 3,700 per tonne as December's end likely saw a decline in Malaysia's palm oil inventories. The reduction can be attributed to diminished production caused by rainy weather and seasonal effects, as reported by a Reuters survey.\n\n<br>\n\n| Future   | Friday's Close | Weekly | Monthly | YTD    |\n| -------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:------:|\n| Soybeans | 1250.25        | -3.34  | -3.49   | -16.23 |\n| Wheat    | 616.27         | -1.87  | 2.72    | -17.11 |\n| Palm Oil | 3682.00        | -1.05  | -0.99   | -9.13  |\n|          |                |        |         |        |\n\n---\n\n<br>\n","tags":["Commodity","Weekly Recap"],"categories":["Markets"]},{"title":"Regional Markets - Brazil Stable,Mexico Gains,Challenges for India and Turkey","url":"/2024/01/07/mmarket_jan07/","content":"\n# Summary\n\n- **This week witnessed Brazilian currency remained stable amid a record trade surplus, while the Brazilian index retreated.

This resilience was attributed to Brazil's record trade surplus of $98.8 billion in 2023, a 60.6% jump from the previous year. The surplus was driven by increased exports in agriculture and extractive industries, boosting foreign currency inflows and supporting the real's strength. In the financial markets, the Brazilian index retreated by 0.5% in the first week, accompanied by a 1.3% drop in Vale's shares.\n\n### Mexico\n\nIn contrast, the Mexican currency demonstrated strength by appreciating to below 16.9 pesos against the USD, registering a 0.45% weekly increase. This positive momentum is attributed to the Banxico minutes, indicating a commitment to tackle the 5.3% inflation recorded in November. The central bank's decision to maintain an overnight interbank interest rate at 11.25% led investors to anticipate a potential interest rate hike.<br>\n\nRecent economic indicators further underscored the resilience of the Mexican economy, with business confidence reaching a ten-year high.

Notably, Argentina's main stock market index, Merval, demonstrated robust growth, surging by 13.52% since the beginning of 2024, reflecting positive investor sentiment and market performance.\n\n<br>\n\n| Markets    | Friday's Close | Week's Change | YTD    |\n| ---------- |:--------------:|:-------------:|:------:|\n| USD/BRL    | 4.87           | 0.46          | -6.72  |\n| USD/MXN    | 16.88          | -0.45         | -11.75 |\n| USD/ARS    | 812.20         | 0.46          | 353.14 |\n| IBOVESPA   | 132023         | -0.51         | 21.16  |\n| IPC MEXICO | 56193          | -2.08         | 8.63   |\n| MERVAL     | 1055381        | 13.52         | 393.64 |\n| BRAZIL-B   | 10.67          | 0.25          | -2.22  |\n| MEXICO     | 9.15           | 0.08          | -0.34  |\n\n<br>\n\n### Asia :<br><br>\n\n### India\n\nThe Indian rupee faced depreciation, surpassing the 83.25 mark on Friday, driven by a surge in global oil prices stemming from reduced output in Libya and disruptions in Red Sea tanker routes. The resultant increase in India's costs for importing crucial energy commodities intensified selling pressure on the rupee. In response, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has consistently intervened in foreign exchange markets to curb further losses, maintaining a delicate balance between a weakening yet stable rupee.<br>\n\nThe BSE Sensex concluded the week at 72,026, marking a 0.3% weekly decline. This dip was predominantly driven by the underperformance of heavyweight IT stocks, influenced by a less optimistic earnings outlook and diminished expectations of prompt rate cuts by the Fed, as revealed in the FOMC minutes release. The market's response to these factors contributed to the slight downturn in the overall Sensex performance for the week.\n\n<br>\n\n| Markets | Friday's Close | Week's Change | YTD   |\n| ------- |:--------------:|:-------------:|:-----:|\n| USD/INR | 83.10          | -0.10         | 1.01  |\n| SENSEX  | 72026          | -0.30         | 20.24 |\n\n<br>\n\n### EU :<br><br>\n\n### Russia\n\nRussian ruble weakened to around 91 per USD in January, primarily influenced by diminished liquidity during the holiday season and also the onging war expenditures which could impact the coutry's budget deficit negatively. \n\nThe ruble-based MOEX Russia index was little changed at 3136 on Friday. On the corporate front, the leaders of growth were Aeroflot (3.5%), VTB (3.2%), TMK (2.1%) and Severstal (1.2%). On the other hand, Sovcomflot (-3.3%), Seligdar (-1.6%), and M.Video (-1.6%) declined.\n\n### Turkey\n\nTurkish lira extended its decline, reaching a new record low of 29.8 per USD. Investor concerns heightened with a 49% hike in the minimum wage, raising fears of increased inflation, especially given the persistently high annual inflation rate of 64.8%. The Turkish government's announcement of a substantial minimum wage increase for 2024 aims to bolster support for the ruling party ahead of local elections in March. The Borsa Istanbul 100 index remained around the 7,500 level, and investors exercised caution, particularly with the upcoming municipal elections in late March, which could introduce uncertainties affecting investment decisions. This cautious approach might persist until after the election, impacting investor confidence and influencing market dynamics.\n\n<br>\n\n| Markets  | Friday's Close | Weekly Change | YTD   |\n| -------- |:--------------:|:-------------:|:-----:|\n| USD/RUB  | 90.92          | 1.88          | 25.42 |\n| USD/TRY  | 29.82          | 1.18          | 59.04 |\n| MOEX     | 3136           | 1.20          | 45.45 |\n| BIST 100 | 7629           | 2.12          | 42.81 |\n| TURKEY-B | 25.47          | 1.78          | 16.98 |\n\n<br><br>\n\n### Other Markets :\n\n| Markets | Friday's Close | Weely Change | YTD    |\n| ------- |:--------------:|:------------:|:------:|\n| USD/CHF | 0.85           | 0.96         | -8.38  |\n| USD/KRW | 90.92          | 1.88         | 25.42  |\n| USD/NGN | 913            | 3.63         | 103.09 |\n| USD/ZAR | 18.69          | 2.22         | 9.05   |\n| TAIEX   | 17519          | 2.30         | 21.89  |\n| NSE     | 79665          | 6.54         | 55.53  |\n\n---\n","tags":["Weekly Recap","Regional Markets"],"categories":["Markets"]},{"title":"Markets Recap - Global Markets Experience Decline","url":"/2024/01/06/macro_jan06/","content":"\n# Summary\n\n- **This week witnessed a global downturn in both stock and bond markets.

Chinese President Xi Jinping's statement regarding the \"reunification of the motherland\" added to the unease. Furthermore, tensions in the Red Sea heightened as Iran deployed a warship, and the U.S. took action against attacking ships linked to Houthi rebels in Yemen.<br>\n\nIn the bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note increased for the week due to contradictory signals in the jobs reports.<br>\n\n**Economic Data** \n\n- S&P Global revised its December manufacturing activity gauge lower, revealing the fastest contraction since August.\n\n- Unexpectedly, the workforce participation rate dropped to 62.5%, reaching its lowest level since February.\n\n- The ISM’s Non-Manufacturing Employment Index sharply fell into contraction territory, reaching its lowest level since July 2020.\n\n<br>\n\n| Index   | Friday's Close | Week's Change | YTD   |\n| ------- |:--------------:|:-------------:|:-----:|\n| S&P 500 | 4,697.24       | -1.52         | 20.59 |\n| DJIA    | 37,466.11      | -0.59         | 11.4  |\n| Nasdaq  | 14,524.07      | -3.25         | 37.42 |\n| Russell | 1,951.14       | -3.75         | 8.83  |\n\n<br><br>\n\n### EU Market :<br><br>\n\n**Stock markets faced headwinds as optimism for an early interest rate cut waned due to a resurgence in inflation in December and widespread geopolitical tensions.** Major stock indexes experienced declines, with France’s CAC 40 Index down by 1.62% and Germany’s DAX losing 0.94%.

Beyond the tragic human toll, which saw the death toll surpassing 90 and hundreds still unaccounted for, there were significant economic repercussions. The earthquake inflicted major damage to infrastructure, particularly in areas housing semiconductor-related factories, posing a threat to manufacturing and supply chains. The damage may also influence the Bank of Japan's potential exit from the negative interest rate policy.<br>\n\n**Persistent concerns about the economy continued to weigh on the stock market.** The Shanghai Composite Index fell by 1.54%, while the blue-chip CSI 300 lost 2.97%. Economic indicators, including the PMI and declining housing prices, signal that the real estate sector remains a drag on the economy. In the bond market, China's 10-year government bond yield dropped to 2.54%, its lowest level since April 2020. The central bank's liquidity support has fueled expectations of interest rate cuts in the coming year to stimulate growth.<br>\n\n**Economic Data :** <br>\n\n- China's official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) contracted for the third consecutive month, falling below consensus to 49.0 in December. \n\n- Declines in new orders and exports accelerated, reflecting ongoing challenges in the manufacturing sector. \n\n- In a bid to support the economy, the People's Bank of China injected RMB 350 billion\n\n<br>\n\n| Index     | Friday's Close | Week's Change | YTD    |\n| --------- |:--------------:|:-------------:|:------:|\n| NIKKEI    | 33,377.42      | -0.26         | 28.5   |\n| SSE SH    | 2,929.18       | -1.54         | -7.24  |\n| CSI 300   | 3,329.11       | -2.97         | -16.37 |\n| Hang Seng | 16,535.33      | -3.0          | -21.23 |\n\n<br><br>\n\n### Other Markets :<br><br>\n\n**US dollar strengthened this week.** The US dollar exhibited strength in the global markets, primarily driven by a surge in the 10-year Treasury yield. Despite weaker fundamentals compared to the previous week, the foreign exchange market operates in a relative context. This strength propelled the US dollar, sending other currencies into declining territory. Notably, the yen experienced a sharp drop, plummeting to the low 145 range against the U.S. dollar, down from approximately 141 at the end of the preceding week.<br>\n\n**Gold price slips.** The strength of the US dollar had a ripple effect on other asset classes. Gold prices slipped as the dollar strengthened, showcasing the inverse relationship between the two.<br>\n\n**Cryptocurrency prices experienced either small declines or remained flat.** A notable factor contributing to the market's stability was the rumored rejection of ETFs on June 3.

Stanley and Joel Lehman. This book challenges the conventional wisdom that setting specific goals is the key to achieving success. It introduces us to the concept of 'novelty search,' which essentially suggests that innovation and greatness might just stem from an unstructured exploration of our passions, rather than from chasing pre-set objectives. **<u>It's like what we often say: Keep your passion alive and live your life without limits.</u>**\n\n<br>\n\n## Content\n\n<br>\n\nThis book starts by contrasting goal-oriented thinking with a more open-ended, passion-driven exploration. The initial chapters bring in various examples to illustrate how a non-objective-driven approach could be more effective, particularly in complex\nand unpredictable scenarios. By Chapter 4, the book posits that having very specific goals might actually limit our potential and cause us to miss out on unforeseen opportunities. This is because overly complex and unprecedented goals are hard to measure, akin to predicting a path in a Markov chain - you can't know the past routes, but you understand that certain prerequisites need to exist for the desired outcome. Essentially, only those who are well-prepared and knowledgeable can seize these opportunities when they arise.\n\n<br>\n\nIn the subsequent chapters, the authors liken this process to being a treasure hunter, constantly reveling in the discovery of new things. Life is full of ups and downs, and people often wish for a restart, to see things from a different perspective. Imagine if life was a game where you could restart infinitely – the fastest path might seem appealing, but it would also strip away the element of surprise and discovery. The book's later chapters showcase real-world case studies where a novelty search approach led to significant breakthroughs across various fields. \n\n<br>\n\n**<u>The real message: Work hard, work smart, and with a bit of luck, you might meet serendipity.</u>**\n\n<br>\n\n## Analysis and Critique\n\n<br>\n\nTo be honest, I'm not entirely on board with the authors' emphasis on the dichotomy between aimlessness and goal-setting. **<u>While I don't advocate for a completely aimless approach, I do believe in setting broader, less specific long-term goals.</u>** For instance, the authors often mention that greatness is 'accidental.' In my view, the goals and methods we set are bound by our present understanding, rooted in past experiences. However, as we progress and evolve, our approaches may change, leading to outcomes that are different – and sometimes 'accidental' – compared to our original intentions. This suggests that we should aim for broad goals, remaining flexible in our journey.\n\n<br>\n\nAnother example they use interpretation of natural evolution. While the authors see diversity as a way to avoid competition which he called “none goal for survival “, I believe it's more about the broader goal of survival and reproduction. If we were to 'restart' life on Earth, humans might look completely different – like creatures from 'Avatar' or another alien species – as long as we're suited to survive. Under this broad goal, species evolve and diversify. So, there's always a goal, albeit not a highly specific one. Maybe It's about pursuing happiness or value, but exploring and discovering like treasure hunters on a path towards the best possible outcomes.\n\n<br><u>**In summary, I want to apply the concept of 'golden mean'  for this book, I recommedate this book for a balance between short-term practical objectives and long-term, vague ambitions. It's about holding onto your long-term goals while being open to abandoning unsuitable new ventures. The journey might be confusing or surprising at times, but that's the essence of life.** </u>\n\n<br>\n\n<u>**May you a journey filled with wonderful discoveries!** </u>\n\n---\n\n### \n","tags":["BookReview"],"categories":["Beyond"]},{"title":"Metals Recap - Diverse Dynamics Amid Economic and Geopolitical Shifts","url":"/2024/01/01/metal_jan01/","content":"\n# Summary\n\n- **This week, the base metal market presented a diverse picture, influenced by macroeconomic trends and geopolitical events. Copper prices dipped slightly in the US, impacted by a stronger dollar and cooling labor market, while in China, supply disruptions were offset by year-end inventory releases. Aluminum found support in the EU and US from potential Fed interest rate cuts, indicated by lower economic indicators. Zinc and nickel, however, faced contrasting fortunes.** \n\n- **Zinc prices were subdued due to seasonal slowdowns and were further dampened by deliveries to LME warehouses. Nickel contended with the dual challenges of geopolitical tensions in the Red Sea and an increased supply, leading to a cautious short-term outlook. Overall, the base metal market was characterized by cautious trading and region-specific responses to global economic and geopolitical developments.** \n\n<br>\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n### Copper :\n\n### <br><br>\n\n**In the last week of December, copper prices faced a slight decline in the US due to a rebound in the dollar index and cooling labor market, while in China, disruptions in supply were offset by year-end inventory clearances, but weakened demand and a lower PMI kept the market under pressure.** \n\n**European and US Markets :** \n\n<br>\n\nThe week began quietly with the London Metal Exchange (LME) and Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) closed for the Christmas holiday on Monday. The absence of significant overseas news during the holiday season put the markets in a wait-and-see mode initially.\n\n<br>\n\nPost-holiday, market sentiment was buoyed by expectations that the United States might start reducing interest rates soon. This anticipation led to a dip in the U.S. dollar index, generally a bullish signal for copper prices. However, the week also brought some concerns. The U.S. reported 218,000 initial jobless claims for the week ending December 23, higher than the forecasted 210,000. This indicates a cooling labor market, which, while potentially pointing to future interest rate cuts, did not immediately bolster copper prices.\n\n<br>\n\nMid-week, the U.S. dollar index rebounded due to investors closing their currency positions towards year-end, which applied downward pressure on copper prices. The week concluded with a modest 0.39% decline in CME's March 2024 copper futures. \n\n<br>\n\n**China's Market Dynamics :**\n\n<br>\n\nIn China, supply-side dynamics were affected by shipping schedule disruptions in certain regions, leading to anticipated delays in imported copper arrivals. This could mean a reduced supply of imported copper in the latter half of the week. Despite this, domestic sellers, aiming to clear year-end inventories, released substantial copper quantities into the market, balancing the supply equation.\n\n<br>\n\nOn the demand side, however, the pressure remained downwards. The final week of the year typically sees muted activity as companies engage in year-end settlements and only purchase as needed. This weak consumption trend was reflected in Shanghai copper's performance, which dropped in a lackluster market.\n\n<br>\n\nThe overall supply of copper remained stable, but high copper prices and significant discounts did not sufficiently stimulate downstream purchasing. The domestic Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for December stood at 49.0%, a 0.4 percentage point decrease from November, signaling a dip in manufacturing prosperity. This, coupled with the expected continued weak consumption, is likely to keep copper prices under pressure. \n\n<br><br>\n\n### Aluminum :\n\n**EU and US Markets :**\n\n<br>\n\nIn the United States, the core PCE price index's annual rate for November came in below expectations, indicating a more significant cooling in inflation than anticipated. This data, coupled with the downward revision of the actual GDP for the third quarter and consumption figures falling short of expectations, has bolstered expectations that the Federal Reserve might consider interest rate cuts. This potential policy shift has provided support to aluminum prices, as lower interest rates can boost economic activity and demand for commodities like aluminum.<br>\n\n**China Market :**\n\n<br>\n\nDespite ongoing weak demand, the traditional off-season in China is impacting the aluminum market. Companies are focusing on cash flow towards the year's end, leading to reduced interest in restocking. It is expected that the reduction in aluminum ingot social inventory will decelerate, but overall inventory levels are likely to remain low. On the domestic macroeconomic front, the situation appears positive. Major state-owned banks have reduced deposit interest rates, which can stimulate economic activity.\n\n<br>\n\nFrom the supply side, low stocks and raw material support are expected to keep aluminum prices firm in the short term. Especially,aluminum can be more sensitive to energy costs and electricity prices, compared to copper, more sensitive to the overall economic health.  Additionally, recent complications in the Red Sea impacting transportation costs, and power load management in Qinghai Province due to earthquake relief efforts, might affect aluminum supply, further supporting prices.\n\n<br>\n\nThe Shanghai Futures Exchange (SHFE) market was closed during the last Friday night session. On the London Metal Exchange (LME), aluminum opened at 2,368/mt last Friday, reaching highs and lows of 2,394.5/mt and 2,363/mt, respectively, before closing at 2,387.5/mt. This closing figure represents an increase of$20.5/mt or 0.87%. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) aluminum saw a notable gain of 2.83% over the week.\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n### Zinc :\n\n**The performance of zinc last week closely mirrored that of copper.** The week saw interruptions in trading due to holidays, with the LME closed on Monday for Christmas and the SHFE zinc market shut on Friday for New Year's Day, including a suspension of night trading.\n\n<br>\n\nIn this context, SHFE zinc struggled to gain upward momentum, reflecting the impact of the off-season. The prices frequently retraced, aligning with the average levels of the preceding workdays. However, growing market optimism about a potential U.S. interest rate cut as early as March fueled bullish sentiments. This was further amplified by the declining U.S. dollar index, which generally bolsters commodity prices.\n\n<br>\n\nDespite this optimism, zinc prices on the LME were restrained. Deliveries to LME warehouses tempered the market's enthusiasm, resulting in a lack of significant upward movement for LME zinc. On the last trading day of the week, LME zinc opened at 2,634/ton, dipping to a low of 2,629/ton. However, during the night trading session, it reached a peak of US$2,675/ton before closing at 2,662/ton, up by 35/ton or 1.33%. Trading volume slightly decreased by 8 lots to 6,880 lots, while open interest saw a notable increase of 3,969 lots to 201,000 lots. Notably, LME zinc inventories rose by 2,700 tons to 224,825 tons, marking an increase of 1.22%.\n\n<br><br>\n\n### Nickel :\n\n**The increased supply, combined with geopolitical uncertainties and fluctuating raw material prices, points towards a potentially volatile market environment.**\n\n<br>\n\nIn the current macroeconomic landscape, geopolitical tensions are significantly influencing the nickel market. The recent escalation of the Red Sea crisis, stemming from the conflict between US military forces and Houthi armed forces on December 31, 2023, has heightened concerns over transportation disruptions in the Red Sea and Eurasian regions. This situation has the potential to increase market risk aversion, as the uncertainty around supply routes intensifies.\n\n<br>\n\nDespite these geopolitical challenges, the dynamics within the nickel market itself reveal a complex picture. The London Metal Exchange (LME) has reported a continuous accumulation of nickel inventory, particularly in Asian warehouses. This suggests a somewhat buffered supply, even in the face of potential transportation challenges.\n\n<br>\n\nFurthermore, the downward pricing trend in nickel sulphate and other raw materials, along with the recent lateral movement in SHFE (Shanghai Futures Exchange) nickel prices, has brought a notable shift. Refined nickel producers, who had previously been operating at a loss, are now seeing a return to profitability. Concurrently, some smelters have resumed normal production levels, indicating an anticipated increase in supply.

However, with the holiday spirit in full swing and trading halted on Monday, the overall market activity remained subdued as many investors were away from their desks.<br>\n\n**Quiet Bond Markets Amid Festivities.** Shifting focus to the bond markets, US treasuries rallied on Wednesday, propelled by strong interest in this year's auction. Despite the holiday-induced quietude, investors showcased a preference for risk assets, aligning with the evolving tone of monetary policies.<br>\n\n**Economic Data** \n\n- The index of manufacturing activity witnessed a substantial decline in December, signaling the potential for further contraction.\n\n- Business activity in the Chicago region dipped into contraction territory, reflecting broader economic challenges.\n\n- Home sales fell short of expectations evend given a drop in mortgage interest rates. \n\n- Jobless claims unexpectedly rose, adding an unforeseen level of concern for the month.\n\n<br>\n\n| Index   | Friday's Close | Week's Change | YTD   |\n| ------- |:--------------:|:-------------:|:-----:|\n| S&P 500 | 4,769.83       | -0.28         | 24.23 |\n| DJIA    | 37,689.54      | -0.05         | 13.70 |\n| Nasdaq  | 15,011.35      | -0.56         | 43.20 |\n| Russell | 2,027.07       | -1.52         | 15.09 |\n\n<br><br>\n\n### EU Market :<br><br>\n\n**EU Stocks Reach New Heights Amid Rate Cut Expectations** The STOXX Euro 600 surged to nearly two-year highs, registering a 0.31% gain on the back of heightened expectations for early-year interest rate cuts. However, the regional indices presented a mixed picture as Germany's DAX posted a 0.22% increase, while Italy's FTSE MIB and France's CAC 40 remained relatively unchanged. Meanwhile, the UK's FTSE 100 saw a notable rise of 0.6%.<br>\n\n**Quiet Bond Markets Anticipate ECB's Caution** In the bond markets, the week unfolded with a tranquil ambiance. The European Central Bank (ECB) is expected to refrain from raising interest rates, driven by concerns over cooling inflation and the looming possibility of a recession. This anticipation has contributed to the subdued nature of the bond markets during the week.<br>\n\n**Economic Data**\n\n- Headline prices decelerating, particularly in Spain, where the rate eased to 3.1% in December. \n\n- The Nationwide Building Society's house price index in the UK remained unchanged sequentially in December, marking a substantial 1.8% year-on-year decline—the most significant annual dip since 2008.

The impetus behind this gain was the anticipation of the Bank of Japan (BOJ) maintaining its ultralow interest rate policy. Remarkably, the Nikkei marked its most substantial annual gains since 2013, recording a 28% surge in 2023, solidifying its position as the best-performing index in Asia.<br>\n\n**Chinese Markets Rally** In China, markets saw a robust uptick in the final week. The government's announcement of new online game approvals and assurances against a potential gaming sector clampdown from the previous week buoyed investor confidence. The Shanghai Composite Index gained 2.06%, and the blue-chip CSI 300 added 2.81%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index also surged, advancing by an impressive 4.33%.\n\n<br>\n\n| Index     | Friday's Close | Week's Change | YTD    |\n| --------- |:--------------:|:-------------:|:------:|\n| NIKKEI    | 33,464.17      | 0.89          | 28.24  |\n| CSI 300   | 3,341.11       | 2.81          | -11.38 |\n| Hang Seng | 17,047.39      | 4.33          | -13.82 |\n\n<br><br>\n\n### Other Markets :<br><br>\n\nIn other markets, on Friday, the Brent crude oil price held its ground at $77.41 per barrel, showcasing a modest 0.34% decline from the preceding day.\n\n<br><br>\n\n---\n","tags":["Weekly Recap","Macro"],"categories":["Markets"]},{"title":"Markets Recap - Peaks,Valleys,and Puzzles","url":"/2023/12/23/macro_dec23/","content":"\n# Summary\n\n- **Global Optimism and Economic Concerns:** **Markets around the world experienced record highs, with the U.S. and European equities reaching new peaks. However, concerns about a looming recession persisted, influencing central bank policies.**\n\n- **Sectoral Challenges and Geopolitical Tensions: While certain sectors thrived, such as U.S. tech giants, others faced headwinds, like China's gaming industry. Geopolitical tensions in the Red Sea propelled oil prices, adding another layer of uncertainty to the global economic landscape.** \n\n<br>\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n### US Market : <br><br>\n\n**Equity markets soar to new heights.** The U.S. stock markets continued their upward trajectory, reaching record levels. Investor confidence grew as concerns about an impending recession diminished. Notably, the S&P500 surged by 84 basis points, with communication services stocks, including Alphabet and Meta Platforms, playing a pivotal role in supporting this advancement.<br>\n\n**The U.S. bonds market witnessed further gains**, accompanied by a decline in short-term bond yields. The Federal Reserve's comments during the week, hinting at potential interest rate cuts in the coming year, influenced market dynamics. However, the Fed expressed worries about the economy slowing down too rapidly, particularly in light of a sharp increase in the unemployment rate. Data from the week supported these concerns, with core PCE rising only 0.1% in November, marking the first decline in headline PCE since 2021. Other notable data included surprising figures in home sales, housing starts, and a significant 8% increase in orders for non-defense capital goods – the largest since 2004.<br><br>\n\n### EU Market :<br><br>\n\n**Parallel trends like US.** European markets mirrored the positive sentiment seen in the U.S., with the European Stoxx 600 rising by 20 basis points to maintain a one-year high. The UK's index saw a 1% gain as inflation cooled down. However, concerns loomed over the economy's proximity to recession, as reflected in the lowered GDP forecast. German companies showed increased pessimism due to continued shrinkage in their order books.<br><br>\n\n### Asian Market :<br><br>\n\n**Japan maintains stability.** Japan's markets experienced modest gains or remained largely unchanged, thanks to support from a more dovish Bank of Japan (BOJ). The BOJ provided forward guidance during the December meeting but refrained from commenting on potential monetary policy tweaks, in contrast to the previous week. The initial weakening of the yen and a decline in the bond market to 0.62% from 0.7% last week were notable.\n\n**China faces market headwinds.** China's stock market witnessed a decline, primarily attributed to new restrictions on the gaming sector. The Shanghai Composite Index dropped by almost 1%, erasing nearly $80 billion in market value. Investors expressed concerns about future earnings and a potential regulatory crackdown, reminiscent of actions taken against tech companies two years ago. Anticipation of further easing by the People's Bank of China (PBOC) in 2024 added to the market uncertainty, driven by deflationary pressures on the economy.<br><br>\n\n### Other Markets :<br><br>\n\n**Oil prices surge amidst red sea concerns.** Global oil prices surged as investor concerns heightened over attacks on shipping in the Red Sea.

Small caps outperformed, surging by 5%. Trading volumes were notably elevated towards the end of the week, reaching a new high for the year. The VIX, often referred to as the fear gauge, dropped to its lowest level post-pandemic.<br>\n\n**Key economic indicators supported a positive market sentiment. The Tuesday report on consumer price inflation aligned with expectations, showing a year-over-year rate of 4%. The Federal Reserve (FED) kept interest rates unchanged as anticipated and gave no indication of pushing back against market expectations for aggressive cuts next year. Retail sales for November unexpectedly rose by 0.3%, though this could be attributed to the holiday season. However, manufacturing sector data hinted at potential disappointments.<br>\n\nThe 10-year Treasury bond yield fell to 4%, a level not seen since July. This drop was influenced by signals from the FED, indicating a cooling inflation and more dovish stance. In this risk-on environment, corporate bonds outperformed.<br><br>\n\n### EU Market :<br><br>\n\nIn Europe, the Stoxx Europe 600 ended 1% higher. However, major indices showed mixed performance, with France outperforming the UK and Germany. The European Central Bank (ECB) left interest rates relatively unchanged but lowered its inflation and growth forecasts for 2023, projecting 2% in 2026. The ECB also announced plans to phase out the reinvestment of maturing securities in its emergency pandemic program, signaling a reduction in bond purchases and reinvestments.<br>\n\nBusiness activity in the Eurozone continued to contract, as indicated by the PMI for manufacturing and service sectors remaining below 50 for the seventh consecutive month. In the UK, GDP remained flat for the three months ending October.<br><br>\n\n### Asian Market :<br><br>\n\nJapan's stock market saw a 2% surge in the Nikkei, supported by signals of interest rate cuts from the FED. However, the strengthening yen could pose challenges for exporters due to expectations of narrowing U.S.-Japan interest rate differentials. Bond yields fell to 0.7% due to investor sentiment on the Bank of Japan's policy pivot. PMI data showed a mild expansion in Japan's private sector business activity, but a political scandal involving the ruling party impacted its popularity.<br>\n\nThe Chinese stock market experienced a decline due to deflationary pressures, with CPI continuing to decline by 0.5% compared to the previous year. Concerns about deflation triggering an economic downturn led to market worries. Other economic indicators presented mixed results, with industrial output growing, retail sales surging by 10%, and fixed asset investment rising, though it missed expectations. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) injected 1 billion into the banking system, but lending rates remained unchanged, prompting speculation that the PBOC may intensify policy support to bolster the economy.<br><br>\n\n### Other Markets :<br><br>\n\nIn other markets, Treasury yields rose, pushing the 10-year yield below 4%. The U.S. dollar fell against all its developed-market peers, driven partly by gains in the euro and pound following signals from the European Central Bank that they are not in a hurry to join the U.S. in interest rate cuts.<br>\n\nOil held steady in a lukewarm session following concerns that supplies are outpacing demand, leading to the longest weekly losing streak in five years.<br>\n\n---\n\n### \n","tags":["Weekly Recap","Macro"],"categories":["Markets"]},{"title":"Econ Events - Why bullfighting facing challenges in Spain","url":"/2023/01/31/econ_jan31/","content":"\n# 问题\n\n作为西班牙的国粹之一斗牛为什么在疫情后却要面临着危机\n\n主要原因是在于2000年前后的房地产商赚的盆满钵满的时候资本开始涌入了斗牛行业，原先的斗牛行业精益求精，如今也成为一个行业。\n\n而为什么如此危险的行业，大家依旧趋之若鹜，是穷病，风浪越大，鱼越贵，这是他们翻身的机会，毕竟基尼系数 西班牙排名全欧倒数第二，这是他们西班牙版本的美国梦，是下层百姓能够翻身 的机会。这背后的原因才更让人心酸。\n\n而当资本入场后，疫情封闭，加上环保人士的抵抗后，斗牛作为国粹却再无容身之所。\n\n而目前斗牛行业要是陨落，那20万的失业人口何去何从，占据0.5%GDP该何去何从.\n\n未来在拉美发光发热，毕竟拉美地区对斗牛更加狂热\n\n也许就是有社会福利作为保障，一个退休金可以养三个韩国老人。拉美式民主+地处温暖地区+基尼系数> 穷人的快乐。饿不死但是不畅快。饿不死，又没上升机会，那不如及时享乐。\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n---\n\n### \n","tags":["Events","Econ"],"categories":["Markets"]},{"title":"Latino Culture - unfinished","url":"/2023/01/30/culture_jan24/","content":"\n# \n\n## Milei's Radical Agenda\n\n为什么他们如此热情？热情奔放的tango, 足球，\n\ncarnival 热辣巴西 samba\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n---\n\n### \n","tags":["Culture","Country"],"categories":["Beyond"]}]
