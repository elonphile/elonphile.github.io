[{"title":"Regional Markets-Brazil Stable,Mexico Gains,Challenges for India and Turkey","url":"/2024/01/07/mmarket_jan13/","content":"\n# Summary\n\n- **This week witnessed Brazilian currency remained stable amid a record trade surplus, while the Brazilian index retreated. Mexico's currency appreciated, supported by Banxico's commitment to combat inflation and positive economic indicators.**\n\n- **Recent economic trends show the Indian rupee depreciating due to rising global oil prices, impacting energy imports, and the BSE Sensex declining, driven by weak IT stocks. In Turkey, the lira hit a record low against the USD, triggered by concerns over a substantial minimum wage hike and persistent high inflation.** \n\n<br>\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n### Latin America : <br><br>\n\n### Brazil\n\nThe Brazilian currency concluded the week stable, fluctuating from a three-week low of 4.92 USD on January 2nd to 4.87 USD on Friday, recording a modest 0.46% weekly drop. This resilience was attributed to Brazil's record trade surplus of $98.8 billion in 2023, a 60.6% jump from the previous year. The surplus was driven by increased exports in agriculture and extractive industries, boosting foreign currency inflows and supporting the real's strength. In the financial markets, the Brazilian index retreated by 0.5% in the first week, accompanied by a 1.3% drop in Vale's shares.\n\n### Mexico\n\nIn contrast, the Mexican currency demonstrated strength by appreciating to below 16.9 pesos against the USD, registering a 0.45% weekly increase. This positive momentum is attributed to the Banxico minutes, indicating a commitment to tackle the 5.3% inflation recorded in November. The central bank's decision to maintain an overnight interbank interest rate at 11.25% led investors to anticipate a potential interest rate hike.<br>\n\nRecent economic indicators further underscored the resilience of the Mexican economy, with business confidence reaching a ten-year high. Additionally, unemployment remained at levels unseen in over twenty years. These factors collectively contribute to a favorable outlook for Mexico's economic stability and growth.\n\n### Argentina\n\nThe USD to ARS exchange rate increased by 0.46% to 804.7500 on Friday for the week. Notably, Argentina's main stock market index, Merval, demonstrated robust growth, surging by 13.52% since the beginning of 2024, reflecting positive investor sentiment and market performance.\n\n<br>\n\n| Markets    | Friday's Close | Week's Change | YTD    |\n| ---------- |:--------------:|:-------------:|:------:|\n| USD/BRL    | 4.87           | 0.46          | -6.72  |\n| USD/MXN    | 16.88          | -0.45         | -11.75 |\n| USD/ARS    | 812.20         | 0.46          | 353.14 |\n| IBOVESPA   | 132023         | -0.51         | 21.16  |\n| IPC MEXICO | 56193          | -2.08         | 8.63   |\n| MERVAL     | 1055381        | 13.52         | 393.64 |\n| BRAZIL-B   | 10.67          | 0.25          | -2.22  |\n| MEXICO     | 9.15           | 0.08          | -0.34  |\n\n<br>\n\n### Asia :<br><br>\n\n### India\n\nThe Indian rupee faced depreciation, surpassing the 83.25 mark on Friday, driven by a surge in global oil prices stemming from reduced output in Libya and disruptions in Red Sea tanker routes. The resultant increase in India's costs for importing crucial energy commodities intensified selling pressure on the rupee. In response, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has consistently intervened in foreign exchange markets to curb further losses, maintaining a delicate balance between a weakening yet stable rupee.<br>\n\nThe BSE Sensex concluded the week at 72,026, marking a 0.3% weekly decline. This dip was predominantly driven by the underperformance of heavyweight IT stocks, influenced by a less optimistic earnings outlook and diminished expectations of prompt rate cuts by the Fed, as revealed in the FOMC minutes release. The market's response to these factors contributed to the slight downturn in the overall Sensex performance for the week.\n\n<br>\n\n| Markets | Friday's Close | Week's Change | YTD   |\n| ------- |:--------------:|:-------------:|:-----:|\n| USD/INR | 83.10          | -0.10         | 1.01  |\n| SENSEX  | 72026          | -0.30         | 20.24 |\n\n<br>\n\n### EU :<br><br>\n\n### Russia\n\nRussian ruble weakened to around 91 per USD in January, primarily influenced by diminished liquidity during the holiday season and also the onging war expenditures which could impact the coutry's budget deficit negatively. \n\nThe ruble-based MOEX Russia index was little changed at 3136 on Friday. On the corporate front, the leaders of growth were Aeroflot (3.5%), VTB (3.2%), TMK (2.1%) and Severstal (1.2%). On the other hand, Sovcomflot (-3.3%), Seligdar (-1.6%), and M.Video (-1.6%) declined.\n\n### Turkey\n\nTurkish lira extended its decline, reaching a new record low of 29.8 per USD. Investor concerns heightened with a 49% hike in the minimum wage, raising fears of increased inflation, especially given the persistently high annual inflation rate of 64.8%. The Turkish government's announcement of a substantial minimum wage increase for 2024 aims to bolster support for the ruling party ahead of local elections in March. The Borsa Istanbul 100 index remained around the 7,500 level, and investors exercised caution, particularly with the upcoming municipal elections in late March, which could introduce uncertainties affecting investment decisions. This cautious approach might persist until after the election, impacting investor confidence and influencing market dynamics.\n\n<br>\n\n| Markets  | Friday's Close | Weekly Change | YTD   |\n| -------- |:--------------:|:-------------:|:-----:|\n| USD/RUB  | 90.92          | 1.88          | 25.42 |\n| USD/TRY  | 29.82          | 1.18          | 59.04 |\n| MOEX     | 3136           | 1.20          | 45.45 |\n| BIST 100 | 7629           | 2.12          | 42.81 |\n| TURKEY-B | 25.47          | 1.78          | 16.98 |\n\n<br><br>\n\n### Other Markets :\n\n| Markets | Friday's Close | Weely Change | YTD    |\n| ------- |:--------------:|:------------:|:------:|\n| USD/CHF | 0.85           | 0.96         | -8.38  |\n| USD/KRW | 90.92          | 1.88         | 25.42  |\n| USD/NGN | 913            | 3.63         | 103.09 |\n| USD/ZAR | 18.69          | 2.22         | 9.05   |\n| TAIEX   | 17519          | 2.30         | 21.89  |\n| NSE     | 79665          | 6.54         | 55.53  |\n\n---\n","tags":["Weekly Recap","Regional Markets"],"categories":["Markets"]},{"title":"Markets Recap - Global Markets Experience Decline","url":"/2024/01/06/macro_jan06/","content":"\n# Summary\n\n- **This week witnessed a global downturn in both stock and bond markets. In the U.S., stock markets declined amid geopolitical concerns and weaknesses in the job market, leading to a rotation into sectors that lagged in the previous year. European markets faced inflation pressures, impacting sentiments and triggering declines, while Asian markets grappled with an earthquake's aftermath and ongoing economic concerns.**\n\n- **The US dollar strengthened, despite weaker fundamentals, influencing currency dynamics and sending other currencies, including the yen, lower.

Chinese President Xi Jinping's statement regarding the \"reunification of the motherland\" added to the unease. Furthermore, tensions in the Red Sea heightened as Iran deployed a warship, and the U.S. took action against attacking ships linked to Houthi rebels in Yemen.<br>\n\nIn the bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note increased for the week due to contradictory signals in the jobs reports.<br>\n\n**Economic Data** \n\n- S&P Global revised its December manufacturing activity gauge lower, revealing the fastest contraction since August.\n\n- Unexpectedly, the workforce participation rate dropped to 62.5%, reaching its lowest level since February.\n\n- The ISM’s Non-Manufacturing Employment Index sharply fell into contraction territory, reaching its lowest level since July 2020.\n\n<br>\n\n| Index   | Friday's Close | Week's Change | YTD   |\n| ------- |:--------------:|:-------------:|:-----:|\n| S&P 500 | 4,697.24       | -1.52         | 20.59 |\n| DJIA    | 37,466.11      | -0.59         | 11.4  |\n| Nasdaq  | 14,524.07      | -3.25         | 37.42 |\n| Russell | 1,951.14       | -3.75         | 8.83  |\n\n<br><br>\n\n### EU Market :<br><br>\n\n**Stock markets faced headwinds as optimism for an early interest rate cut waned due to a resurgence in inflation in December and widespread geopolitical tensions.** Major stock indexes experienced declines, with France’s CAC 40 Index down by 1.62% and Germany’s DAX losing 0.94%. In contrast, Italy’s FTSE MIB managed a modest gain of 0.29%, while the UK’s FTSE 100 Index slid by 0.56%.<br>\n\n**Similar to the U.S., European government bonds witnessed a significant drop, resulting in higher yields, as traders tempered expectations for aggressive rate cuts.** The yield on the benchmark 10-year German bund surpassed 2.1%, and in Italy, the 10-year government bond yield closed the week above 3.8%. Meanwhile, the UK’s 10-year gilt ended with an almost 3.8% yield.<br>\n\n**Economic Data**\n\n- Annual consumer price growth in the EU rose to 2.9%, rebounding from a two-year low of 2.4% in November.\n\n- Despite starting from low levels, demand for home purchase loans showed signs of recovery in the final month of 2023. Mortgage approvals increased to just above 50,000, up from 47,890 in November, according to the Bank of England.\n\n<br>\n\n| Index       | Friday's Close | Week's Change | YTD   |\n| ----------- |:--------------:|:-------------:|:-----:|\n| STOXX 600   | 476.38         | -0.55         | 7.19  |\n| Germany DAX | 16,594.21      | -0.94         | 13.58 |\n| France CAC  | 7,420.69       | -1.62         | 8.16  |\n| UK FTSE     | 7,689.6        | -0.56         | -0.13 |\n\n<br>\n\n| 10y Bond | Friday's Yield | Week's Change | YTD   |\n| -------- |:--------------:|:-------------:|:-----:|\n| US       | 4.04           | 0.19          | 0.48  |\n| UK       | 3.79           | 0.25          | 0.31  |\n| Germany  | 2.14           | 0.11          | -0.07 |\n| Japan    | 0.60           | -0.02         | 0.10  |\n| China    | 2.57           | -0.01         | -0.32 |\n\n<br>\n\n### Asian Market :<br><br>\n\n**The Japanese stock market resumed fell because of earthquake.** The Japanese stock market resumed trading on Thursday after the holiday, witnessing a decline with the Nikkei dropping by 0.26%.This downturn was attributed to an earthquake in the Hokuriku region, accompanied by aftershocks. Beyond the tragic human toll, which saw the death toll surpassing 90 and hundreds still unaccounted for, there were significant economic repercussions. The earthquake inflicted major damage to infrastructure, particularly in areas housing semiconductor-related factories, posing a threat to manufacturing and supply chains. The damage may also influence the Bank of Japan's potential exit from the negative interest rate policy.<br>\n\n**Persistent concerns about the economy continued to weigh on the stock market.** The Shanghai Composite Index fell by 1.54%, while the blue-chip CSI 300 lost 2.97%. Economic indicators, including the PMI and declining housing prices, signal that the real estate sector remains a drag on the economy. In the bond market, China's 10-year government bond yield dropped to 2.54%, its lowest level since April 2020. The central bank's liquidity support has fueled expectations of interest rate cuts in the coming year to stimulate growth.<br>\n\n**Economic Data :** <br>\n\n- China's official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) contracted for the third consecutive month, falling below consensus to 49.0 in December. \n\n- Declines in new orders and exports accelerated, reflecting ongoing challenges in the manufacturing sector. \n\n- In a bid to support the economy, the People's Bank of China injected RMB 350 billion\n\n<br>\n\n| Index     | Friday's Close | Week's Change | YTD    |\n| --------- |:--------------:|:-------------:|:------:|\n| NIKKEI    | 33,377.42      | -0.26         | 28.5   |\n| SSE SH    | 2,929.18       | -1.54         | -7.24  |\n| CSI 300   | 3,329.11       | -2.97         | -16.37 |\n| Hang Seng | 16,535.33      | -3.0          | -21.23 |\n\n<br><br>\n\n### Other Markets :<br><br>\n\n**US dollar strengthened this week.** The US dollar exhibited strength in the global markets, primarily driven by a surge in the 10-year Treasury yield. Despite weaker fundamentals compared to the previous week, the foreign exchange market operates in a relative context. This strength propelled the US dollar, sending other currencies into declining territory. Notably, the yen experienced a sharp drop, plummeting to the low 145 range against the U.S. dollar, down from approximately 141 at the end of the preceding week.<br>\n\n**Gold price slips.** The strength of the US dollar had a ripple effect on other asset classes. Gold prices slipped as the dollar strengthened, showcasing the inverse relationship between the two.<br>\n\n**Cryptocurrency prices experienced either small declines or remained flat.** A notable factor contributing to the market's stability was the rumored rejection of ETFs on June 3. This rumor caused fluctuations of around 8.5% in Bitcoin prices. As cryptocurrency markets continue to evolve, external factors, such as regulatory decisions, can significantly impact their trajectory.<br>\n\n| Other markets | Friday's close | Weekly change | YTD    |\n| ------------- |:--------------:|:-------------:|:------:|\n| EUR/USD       | 1.09           | -1.09         | 4.04   |\n| GBP/USD       | 1.27           | -0.39         | 6.48   |\n| EUR/SEK       | 11.17          | 1.3           | -0.45  |\n| USD/JPY       | 144.76         | 2.36          | 8.6    |\n| USD/CNY       | 7.11           | 0.04          | 3.32   |\n| USD/RUB       | 91.32          | 3.25          | 26.62  |\n| USD/INR       | 83.24          | 1.14          | 0.72   |\n| GOLD          | 2,042.4        | -0.97         | 9.56   |\n| CRUDE OIL     | 73.81          | 3.01          | 0.05   |\n| BTC-USD       | 44,162.69      | 4.9           | 160.52 |\n| ETH-USD       | 2,268.65       | -1.39         | 78.72  |\n\n<br><br>\n\n---\n","tags":["Macro","Weekly Recap"],"categories":["Markets"]},{"title":"Metals Recap - Diverse Dynamics Amid Economic and Geopolitical Shifts","url":"/2024/01/01/metal_jan01/","content":"\n# Summary\n\n- **This week, the base metal market presented a diverse picture, influenced by macroeconomic trends and geopolitical events. Copper prices dipped slightly in the US, impacted by a stronger dollar and cooling labor market, while in China, supply disruptions were offset by year-end inventory releases. Aluminum found support in the EU and US from potential Fed interest rate cuts, indicated by lower economic indicators. Zinc and nickel, however, faced contrasting fortunes.** \n\n- **Zinc prices were subdued due to seasonal slowdowns and were further dampened by deliveries to LME warehouses. Nickel contended with the dual challenges of geopolitical tensions in the Red Sea and an increased supply, leading to a cautious short-term outlook. Overall, the base metal market was characterized by cautious trading and region-specific responses to global economic and geopolitical developments.** \n\n<br>\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n### Copper :\n\n### <br><br>\n\n**In the last week of December, copper prices faced a slight decline in the US due to a rebound in the dollar index and cooling labor market, while in China, disruptions in supply were offset by year-end inventory clearances, but weakened demand and a lower PMI kept the market under pressure.** \n\n**European and US Markets :** \n\n<br>\n\nThe week began quietly with the London Metal Exchange (LME) and Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) closed for the Christmas holiday on Monday. The absence of significant overseas news during the holiday season put the markets in a wait-and-see mode initially.\n\n<br>\n\nPost-holiday, market sentiment was buoyed by expectations that the United States might start reducing interest rates soon. This anticipation led to a dip in the U.S. dollar index, generally a bullish signal for copper prices. However, the week also brought some concerns. The U.S. reported 218,000 initial jobless claims for the week ending December 23, higher than the forecasted 210,000. This indicates a cooling labor market, which, while potentially pointing to future interest rate cuts, did not immediately bolster copper prices.\n\n<br>\n\nMid-week, the U.S. dollar index rebounded due to investors closing their currency positions towards year-end, which applied downward pressure on copper prices. The week concluded with a modest 0.39% decline in CME's March 2024 copper futures. \n\n<br>\n\n**China's Market Dynamics :**\n\n<br>\n\nIn China, supply-side dynamics were affected by shipping schedule disruptions in certain regions, leading to anticipated delays in imported copper arrivals. This could mean a reduced supply of imported copper in the latter half of the week. Despite this, domestic sellers, aiming to clear year-end inventories, released substantial copper quantities into the market, balancing the supply equation.\n\n<br>\n\nOn the demand side, however, the pressure remained downwards. The final week of the year typically sees muted activity as companies engage in year-end settlements and only purchase as needed. This weak consumption trend was reflected in Shanghai copper's performance, which dropped in a lackluster market.\n\n<br>\n\nThe overall supply of copper remained stable, but high copper prices and significant discounts did not sufficiently stimulate downstream purchasing. The domestic Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for December stood at 49.0%, a 0.4 percentage point decrease from November, signaling a dip in manufacturing prosperity. This, coupled with the expected continued weak consumption, is likely to keep copper prices under pressure. \n\n<br><br>\n\n### Aluminum :\n\n**EU and US Markets :**\n\n<br>\n\nIn the United States, the core PCE price index's annual rate for November came in below expectations, indicating a more significant cooling in inflation than anticipated. This data, coupled with the downward revision of the actual GDP for the third quarter and consumption figures falling short of expectations, has bolstered expectations that the Federal Reserve might consider interest rate cuts. This potential policy shift has provided support to aluminum prices, as lower interest rates can boost economic activity and demand for commodities like aluminum.<br>\n\n**China Market :**\n\n<br>\n\nDespite ongoing weak demand, the traditional off-season in China is impacting the aluminum market. Companies are focusing on cash flow towards the year's end, leading to reduced interest in restocking. It is expected that the reduction in aluminum ingot social inventory will decelerate, but overall inventory levels are likely to remain low. On the domestic macroeconomic front, the situation appears positive. Major state-owned banks have reduced deposit interest rates, which can stimulate economic activity.\n\n<br>\n\nFrom the supply side, low stocks and raw material support are expected to keep aluminum prices firm in the short term. Especially,aluminum can be more sensitive to energy costs and electricity prices, compared to copper, more sensitive to the overall economic health.  Additionally, recent complications in the Red Sea impacting transportation costs, and power load management in Qinghai Province due to earthquake relief efforts, might affect aluminum supply, further supporting prices.\n\n<br>\n\nThe Shanghai Futures Exchange (SHFE) market was closed during the last Friday night session. On the London Metal Exchange (LME), aluminum opened at 2,368/mt last Friday, reaching highs and lows of 2,394.5/mt and 2,363/mt, respectively, before closing at 2,387.5/mt. This closing figure represents an increase of$20.5/mt or 0.87%. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) aluminum saw a notable gain of 2.83% over the week.\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n### Zinc :\n\n**The performance of zinc last week closely mirrored that of copper.** The week saw interruptions in trading due to holidays, with the LME closed on Monday for Christmas and the SHFE zinc market shut on Friday for New Year's Day, including a suspension of night trading.\n\n<br>\n\nIn this context, SHFE zinc struggled to gain upward momentum, reflecting the impact of the off-season. The prices frequently retraced, aligning with the average levels of the preceding workdays. However, growing market optimism about a potential U.S. interest rate cut as early as March fueled bullish sentiments. This was further amplified by the declining U.S. dollar index, which generally bolsters commodity prices.\n\n<br>\n\nDespite this optimism, zinc prices on the LME were restrained. Deliveries to LME warehouses tempered the market's enthusiasm, resulting in a lack of significant upward movement for LME zinc. On the last trading day of the week, LME zinc opened at 2,634/ton, dipping to a low of 2,629/ton. However, during the night trading session, it reached a peak of US$2,675/ton before closing at 2,662/ton, up by 35/ton or 1.33%. Trading volume slightly decreased by 8 lots to 6,880 lots, while open interest saw a notable increase of 3,969 lots to 201,000 lots. Notably, LME zinc inventories rose by 2,700 tons to 224,825 tons, marking an increase of 1.22%.\n\n<br><br>\n\n### Nickel :\n\n**The increased supply, combined with geopolitical uncertainties and fluctuating raw material prices, points towards a potentially volatile market environment.**\n\n<br>\n\nIn the current macroeconomic landscape, geopolitical tensions are significantly influencing the nickel market. The recent escalation of the Red Sea crisis, stemming from the conflict between US military forces and Houthi armed forces on December 31, 2023, has heightened concerns over transportation disruptions in the Red Sea and Eurasian regions. This situation has the potential to increase market risk aversion, as the uncertainty around supply routes intensifies.\n\n<br>\n\nDespite these geopolitical challenges, the dynamics within the nickel market itself reveal a complex picture. The London Metal Exchange (LME) has reported a continuous accumulation of nickel inventory, particularly in Asian warehouses. This suggests a somewhat buffered supply, even in the face of potential transportation challenges.\n\n<br>\n\nFurthermore, the downward pricing trend in nickel sulphate and other raw materials, along with the recent lateral movement in SHFE (Shanghai Futures Exchange) nickel prices, has brought a notable shift. Refined nickel producers, who had previously been operating at a loss, are now seeing a return to profitability. Concurrently, some smelters have resumed normal production levels, indicating an anticipated increase in supply. Given these factors, the short-term outlook for nickel suggests a potential for downside pressure. \n\n<br><br>\n\n---\n\n| Future   | Friday's Close | Week's Change | YTD   |\n| -------- |:--------------:|:-------------:|:-----:|\n| Copper   | 3.88           | -0.39         | 1.97  |\n| Aluminum | 2,332.25       | 2.83          | -3.24 |\n| Zinc LME | 2,662          | -             | -     |\n| Nickel   |                |               |       |\n","tags":["Weekly Recap","Metals"],"categories":["Markets"]},{"title":"Metals Recap - Diverse Dynamics Amid Economic and Geopolitical Shifts","url":"/2024/01/01/metal_jan08/","content":"\n# Summary\n\n- **This week, the base metal market presented a diverse picture, influenced by macroeconomic trends and geopolitical events.

This indicates a cooling labor market, which, while potentially pointing to future interest rate cuts, did not immediately bolster copper prices.\n\n<br>\n\nMid-week, the U.S. dollar index rebounded due to investors closing their currency positions towards year-end, which applied downward pressure on copper prices. The week concluded with a modest 0.39% decline in CME's March 2024 copper futures. \n\n<br>\n\n**China's Market Dynamics :**\n\n<br>\n\nIn China, supply-side dynamics were affected by shipping schedule disruptions in certain regions, leading to anticipated delays in imported copper arrivals. This could mean a reduced supply of imported copper in the latter half of the week. Despite this, domestic sellers, aiming to clear year-end inventories, released substantial copper quantities into the market, balancing the supply equation.\n\n<br>\n\nOn the demand side, however, the pressure remained downwards. The final week of the year typically sees muted activity as companies engage in year-end settlements and only purchase as needed. This weak consumption trend was reflected in Shanghai copper's performance, which dropped in a lackluster market.\n\n<br>\n\nThe overall supply of copper remained stable, but high copper prices and significant discounts did not sufficiently stimulate downstream purchasing. The domestic Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for December stood at 49.0%, a 0.4 percentage point decrease from November, signaling a dip in manufacturing prosperity. This, coupled with the expected continued weak consumption, is likely to keep copper prices under pressure. \n\n<br><br>\n\n### Aluminum :\n\n**EU and US Markets :**\n\n<br>\n\nIn the United States, the core PCE price index's annual rate for November came in below expectations, indicating a more significant cooling in inflation than anticipated. This data, coupled with the downward revision of the actual GDP for the third quarter and consumption figures falling short of expectations, has bolstered expectations that the Federal Reserve might consider interest rate cuts. This potential policy shift has provided support to aluminum prices, as lower interest rates can boost economic activity and demand for commodities like aluminum.<br>\n\n**China Market :**\n\n<br>\n\nDespite ongoing weak demand, the traditional off-season in China is impacting the aluminum market. Companies are focusing on cash flow towards the year's end, leading to reduced interest in restocking. It is expected that the reduction in aluminum ingot social inventory will decelerate, but overall inventory levels are likely to remain low. On the domestic macroeconomic front, the situation appears positive. Major state-owned banks have reduced deposit interest rates, which can stimulate economic activity.\n\n<br>\n\nFrom the supply side, low stocks and raw material support are expected to keep aluminum prices firm in the short term. Especially,aluminum can be more sensitive to energy costs and electricity prices, compared to copper, more sensitive to the overall economic health.  Additionally, recent complications in the Red Sea impacting transportation costs, and power load management in Qinghai Province due to earthquake relief efforts, might affect aluminum supply, further supporting prices.\n\n<br>\n\nThe Shanghai Futures Exchange (SHFE) market was closed during the last Friday night session. On the London Metal Exchange (LME), aluminum opened at 2,368/mt last Friday, reaching highs and lows of 2,394.5/mt and 2,363/mt, respectively, before closing at 2,387.5/mt. This closing figure represents an increase of$20.5/mt or 0.87%. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) aluminum saw a notable gain of 2.83% over the week.\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n### Zinc :\n\n**The performance of zinc last week closely mirrored that of copper.** The week saw interruptions in trading due to holidays, with the LME closed on Monday for Christmas and the SHFE zinc market shut on Friday for New Year's Day, including a suspension of night trading.\n\n<br>\n\nIn this context, SHFE zinc struggled to gain upward momentum, reflecting the impact of the off-season. The prices frequently retraced, aligning with the average levels of the preceding workdays. However, growing market optimism about a potential U.S. interest rate cut as early as March fueled bullish sentiments. This was further amplified by the declining U.S. dollar index, which generally bolsters commodity prices.\n\n<br>\n\nDespite this optimism, zinc prices on the LME were restrained. Deliveries to LME warehouses tempered the market's enthusiasm, resulting in a lack of significant upward movement for LME zinc. On the last trading day of the week, LME zinc opened at 2,634/ton, dipping to a low of 2,629/ton. However, during the night trading session, it reached a peak of US$2,675/ton before closing at 2,662/ton, up by 35/ton or 1.33%. Trading volume slightly decreased by 8 lots to 6,880 lots, while open interest saw a notable increase of 3,969 lots to 201,000 lots. Notably, LME zinc inventories rose by 2,700 tons to 224,825 tons, marking an increase of 1.22%.\n\n<br><br>\n\n### Nickel :\n\n**The increased supply, combined with geopolitical uncertainties and fluctuating raw material prices, points towards a potentially volatile market environment.**\n\n<br>\n\nIn the current macroeconomic landscape, geopolitical tensions are significantly influencing the nickel market. The recent escalation of the Red Sea crisis, stemming from the conflict between US military forces and Houthi armed forces on December 31, 2023, has heightened concerns over transportation disruptions in the Red Sea and Eurasian regions. This situation has the potential to increase market risk aversion, as the uncertainty around supply routes intensifies.\n\n<br>\n\nDespite these geopolitical challenges, the dynamics within the nickel market itself reveal a complex picture. The London Metal Exchange (LME) has reported a continuous accumulation of nickel inventory, particularly in Asian warehouses. This suggests a somewhat buffered supply, even in the face of potential transportation challenges.\n\n<br>\n\nFurthermore, the downward pricing trend in nickel sulphate and other raw materials, along with the recent lateral movement in SHFE (Shanghai Futures Exchange) nickel prices, has brought a notable shift. Refined nickel producers, who had previously been operating at a loss, are now seeing a return to profitability. Concurrently, some smelters have resumed normal production levels, indicating an anticipated increase in supply. Given these factors, the short-term outlook for nickel suggests a potential for downside pressure. \n\n<br><br>\n\n---\n\n| Future        | Friday's Close | Weekly | Monthly | YTD    |\n| ------------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:------:|\n| Copper        | 3.79           | -2.45  | 1.87    | -3.21  |\n| Aluminum      | 2274.50        | -4.59  | 5.86    | -0.91  |\n| Zinc          | 2550.00        | --4.06 | 5.00    | -15.66 |\n| Nickel        | 15835          | -4.02  | -0.66   | -42.62 |\n| Cobalt        | 29135          | 0      | -12.82  | -41.73 |\n| LME Index     | 3670.30        | -2.89  | 2.35    | -6.02  |\n| SSE Con       | 8685.58        | -3.70  | -4.48   | -22.23 |\n| Freignt Index | 1759.57        | 40.21  | 74.08   | 58.87  |\n\n<br>\n\n| Electricity | Friday's Close | Weekly | Monthly | YTD    |\n| ----------- |:--------------:|:------:|:-------:|:------:|\n| UK          | 86.85          | -0.06  | -3.06   | -52.17 |\n| Germany     | 88.72          | 160.48 | -23.91  | -0.10  |\n| France      | 90.25          | -2.70  | -8.89   | -58.90 |\n| Italy       | 91.17          | -9.93  | -31.65  | -50.43 |\n| Spain       | 91.36          | -6.96  | -19.25  | -16.32 |\n","tags":["Weekly Recap","Metals"],"categories":["Markets"]},{"title":"A Playlist for Imagine Dragons","url":"/2023/12/31/playlist_dec31/","content":"\n# \n\n# \"Music has the power to move the soul\n\n# Imagine Dragons' anthems ignite the fire within.\"\n\n<br>\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n### <br><br>\n\n## Playlist\n\n\"Symphony\"\n\n\"Natural\"\n\n\"Bones\"  \n\n\"Believer\" \n\n\"Thunder\" \n\n\"On Top of the World\" \n\n\"Enemy\" \n\n\"Sharks\" \n\n\"Higher Ground\" \n\n\"Only\" \n\n\"Love\" \n\n---\n\n### \n","tags":["Playlist"],"categories":["Beyond"]},{"title":"Markets Recap - Diverse Trends Define Year-End Landscape","url":"/2023/12/30/macro_dec30/","content":"\n# Summary\n\n- **Global markets present a mixed picture.

However, with the holiday spirit in full swing and trading halted on Monday, the overall market activity remained subdued as many investors were away from their desks.<br>\n\n**Quiet Bond Markets Amid Festivities.** Shifting focus to the bond markets, US treasuries rallied on Wednesday, propelled by strong interest in this year's auction.

However, the regional indices presented a mixed picture as Germany's DAX posted a 0.22% increase, while Italy's FTSE MIB and France's CAC 40 remained relatively unchanged. Meanwhile, the UK's FTSE 100 saw a notable rise of 0.6%.<br>\n\n**Quiet Bond Markets Anticipate ECB's Caution** In the bond markets, the week unfolded with a tranquil ambiance. The European Central Bank (ECB) is expected to refrain from raising interest rates, driven by concerns over cooling inflation and the looming possibility of a recession. This anticipation has contributed to the subdued nature of the bond markets during the week.<br>\n\n**Economic Data**\n\n- Headline prices decelerating, particularly in Spain, where the rate eased to 3.1% in December. \n\n- The Nationwide Building Society's house price index in the UK remained unchanged sequentially in December, marking a substantial 1.8% year-on-year decline—the most significant annual dip since 2008.

The impetus behind this gain was the anticipation of the Bank of Japan (BOJ) maintaining its ultralow interest rate policy. Remarkably, the Nikkei marked its most substantial annual gains since 2013, recording a 28% surge in 2023, solidifying its position as the best-performing index in Asia.<br>\n\n**Chinese Markets Rally** In China, markets saw a robust uptick in the final week. The government's announcement of new online game approvals and assurances against a potential gaming sector clampdown from the previous week buoyed investor confidence. The Shanghai Composite Index gained 2.06%, and the blue-chip CSI 300 added 2.81%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index also surged, advancing by an impressive 4.33%.\n\n<br>\n\n| Index     | Friday's Close | Week's Change | YTD    |\n| --------- |:--------------:|:-------------:|:------:|\n| NIKKEI    | 33,464.17      | 0.89          | 28.24  |\n| CSI 300   | 3,341.11       | 2.81          | -11.38 |\n| Hang Seng | 17,047.39      | 4.33          | -13.82 |\n\n<br><br>\n\n### Other Markets :<br><br>\n\nIn other markets, on Friday, the Brent crude oil price held its ground at $77.41 per barrel, showcasing a modest 0.34% decline from the preceding day.\n\n<br><br>\n\n---\n","tags":["Macro","Weekly Recap"],"categories":["Markets"]},{"title":"Markets Recap - Peaks,Valleys,and Puzzles","url":"/2023/12/23/macro_dec23/","content":"\n# Summary\n\n- **Global Optimism and Economic Concerns:** **Markets around the world experienced record highs, with the U.S. and European equities reaching new peaks.

The Federal Reserve's comments during the week, hinting at potential interest rate cuts in the coming year, influenced market dynamics. However, the Fed expressed worries about the economy slowing down too rapidly, particularly in light of a sharp increase in the unemployment rate. Data from the week supported these concerns, with core PCE rising only 0.1% in November, marking the first decline in headline PCE since 2021. Other notable data included surprising figures in home sales, housing starts, and a significant 8% increase in orders for non-defense capital goods – the largest since 2004.<br><br>\n\n### EU Market :<br><br>\n\n**Parallel trends like US.** European markets mirrored the positive sentiment seen in the U.S., with the European Stoxx 600 rising by 20 basis points to maintain a one-year high.

German companies showed increased pessimism due to continued shrinkage in their order books.<br><br>\n\n### Asian Market :<br><br>\n\n**Japan maintains stability.** Japan's markets experienced modest gains or remained largely unchanged, thanks to support from a more dovish Bank of Japan (BOJ). The BOJ provided forward guidance during the December meeting but refrained from commenting on potential monetary policy tweaks, in contrast to the previous week. The initial weakening of the yen and a decline in the bond market to 0.62% from 0.7% last week were notable.\n\n**China faces market headwinds.** China's stock market witnessed a decline, primarily attributed to new restrictions on the gaming sector. The Shanghai Composite Index dropped by almost 1%, erasing nearly $80 billion in market value. Investors expressed concerns about future earnings and a potential regulatory crackdown, reminiscent of actions taken against tech companies two years ago. Anticipation of further easing by the People's Bank of China (PBOC) in 2024 added to the market uncertainty, driven by deflationary pressures on the economy.<br><br>\n\n### Other Markets :<br><br>\n\n**Oil prices surge amidst red sea concerns.** Global oil prices surged as investor concerns heightened over attacks on shipping in the Red Sea.

The VIX, often referred to as the fear gauge, dropped to its lowest level post-pandemic.<br>\n\n**Key economic indicators supported a positive market sentiment. The Tuesday report on consumer price inflation aligned with expectations, showing a year-over-year rate of 4%. The Federal Reserve (FED) kept interest rates unchanged as anticipated and gave no indication of pushing back against market expectations for aggressive cuts next year. Retail sales for November unexpectedly rose by 0.3%, though this could be attributed to the holiday season. However, manufacturing sector data hinted at potential disappointments.<br>\n\nThe 10-year Treasury bond yield fell to 4%, a level not seen since July.

However, the strengthening yen could pose challenges for exporters due to expectations of narrowing U.S.-Japan interest rate differentials. Bond yields fell to 0.7% due to investor sentiment on the Bank of Japan's policy pivot. PMI data showed a mild expansion in Japan's private sector business activity, but a political scandal involving the ruling party impacted its popularity.<br>\n\nThe Chinese stock market experienced a decline due to deflationary pressures, with CPI continuing to decline by 0.5% compared to the previous year. Concerns about deflation triggering an economic downturn led to market worries. Other economic indicators presented mixed results, with industrial output growing, retail sales surging by 10%, and fixed asset investment rising, though it missed expectations. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) injected 1 billion into the banking system, but lending rates remained unchanged, prompting speculation that the PBOC may intensify policy support to bolster the economy.<br><br>\n\n### Other Markets :<br><br>\n\nIn other markets, Treasury yields rose, pushing the 10-year yield below 4%.
