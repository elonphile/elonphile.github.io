        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h1><ul><li><p><strong>Global Optimism and Economic Concerns:</strong> <strong>Markets around the world experienced record highs, with the U.S. and European equities reaching new peaks. However, concerns about a looming recession persisted, influencing central bank policies.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Sectoral Challenges and Geopolitical Tensions: While certain sectors thrived, such as U.S. tech giants, others faced headwinds, like China’s gaming industry. Geopolitical tensions in the Red Sea propelled oil prices, adding another layer of uncertainty to the global economic landscape.</strong></p></li></ul><br><span id="more"></span><!-- more --><!-- more --><h3 id="US-Market"><a href="#US-Market" class="headerlink" title="US Market : "></a>US Market : <br><br></h3><p><strong>Equity markets soar to new heights.</strong> The U.S. stock markets continued their upward trajectory, reaching record levels. Investor confidence grew as concerns about an impending recession diminished. Notably, the S&amp;P500 surged by 84 basis points, with communication services stocks, including Alphabet and Meta Platforms, playing a pivotal role in supporting this advancement.<br></p><p><strong>The U.S. bonds market witnessed further gains</strong>, accompanied by a decline in short-term bond yields. The Federal Reserve’s comments during the week, hinting at potential interest rate cuts in the coming year, influenced market dynamics. However, the Fed expressed worries about the economy slowing down too rapidly, particularly in light of a sharp increase in the unemployment rate. Data from the week supported these concerns, with core PCE rising only 0.1% in November, marking the first decline in headline PCE since 2021. Other notable data included surprising figures in home sales, housing starts, and a significant 8% increase in orders for non-defense capital goods – the largest since 2004.<br><br></p><h3 id="EU-Market"><a href="#EU-Market" class="headerlink" title="EU Market :"></a>EU Market :<br><br></h3><p><strong>Parallel trends like US.</strong> European markets mirrored the positive sentiment seen in the U.S., with the European Stoxx 600 rising by 20 basis points to maintain a one-year high. The UK’s index saw a 1% gain as inflation cooled down. However, concerns loomed over the economy’s proximity to recession, as reflected in the lowered GDP forecast. German companies showed increased pessimism due to continued shrinkage in their order books.<br><br></p><h3 id="Asian-Market"><a href="#Asian-Market" class="headerlink" title="Asian Market :"></a>Asian Market :<br><br></h3><p><strong>Japan maintains stability.</strong> Japan’s markets experienced modest gains or remained largely unchanged, thanks to support from a more dovish Bank of Japan (BOJ). The BOJ provided forward guidance during the December meeting but refrained from commenting on potential monetary policy tweaks, in contrast to the previous week. The initial weakening of the yen and a decline in the bond market to 0.62% from 0.7% last week were notable.</p><p><strong>China faces market headwinds.</strong> China’s stock market witnessed a decline, primarily attributed to new restrictions on the gaming sector. The Shanghai Composite Index dropped by almost 1%, erasing nearly $80 billion in market value. Investors expressed concerns about future earnings and a potential regulatory crackdown, reminiscent of actions taken against tech companies two years ago. Anticipation of further easing by the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) in 2024 added to the market uncertainty, driven by deflationary pressures on the economy.<br><br></p><h3 id="Other-Markets"><a href="#Other-Markets" class="headerlink" title="Other Markets :"></a>Other Markets :<br><br></h3><p><strong>Oil prices surge amidst red sea concerns.</strong> Global oil prices surged as investor concerns heightened over attacks on shipping in the Red Sea. The geopolitical tensions in the region drove increased attention to the potential disruptions in oil supply chains.<br></p><hr><h3 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h3>]]></content>
